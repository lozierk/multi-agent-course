This workflow is useful for building applications like intelligent document search, semantic search engines, or AI-based question-answering systems.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "Embedding the chunks of text is a crucial step in preparing the data for storage in a **vector database** like Qdrant. In this step, we convert each text chunk into a **numerical representation** (vector) that captures its semantic meaning. This allows us to perform advanced operations like **semantic search**, **similarity comparison**, and **retrieval** based on meaning, rather than just keyword matching.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why we Embed?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Vector Representation**: Embedding transforms text into vectors (lists of numbers) that machine learning models can understand. These vectors represent the **semantic meaning** of the text, allowing similar texts to be grouped together, even if they don’t share exact words.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Efficient Search**: Storing these vectors in a vector database enables **fast similarity searches**. For example, if you ask a question or search for a document, the vector database can quickly find and return the most relevant results based on the meaning of the text, not just exact matches.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Contextual Understanding**: The embedding process allows the system to \"understand\" the context of words, which improves the relevance and accuracy of search results. For example, it helps understand that \"machine learning\" and \"artificial intelligence\" are related concepts, even if they don't appear together in the same document.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What it Does?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Transforms text** into dense vectors, capturing the **semantic essence** of the content.\n",
        "- These vectors are then stored in a **vector database** (Qdrant in our case) for fast retrieval and comparison based on similarity, enabling features like document search or answering questions.\n",
