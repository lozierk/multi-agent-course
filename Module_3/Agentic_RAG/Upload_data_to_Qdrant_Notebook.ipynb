        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to process unstructured document data (such as PDF files) and store it in a local vector database using Qdrant. This workflow is useful for building applications like intelligent document search, semantic search engines, or AI-based question-answering systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will start by extracting text content from PDF files, convert that text into numerical representations called embeddings, and finally upload those embeddings into a Qdrant database for efficient retrieval and future use.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we will use two types of PDF data:\n",
        "- **OpenAI documentation** (covering tools, APIs, and usage guidelines).\n",
        "- **10-K financial filings** (official company reports and financial statements by Uber and Lyft).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data access\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Generate semantic embeddings** for each chunk of text using a model from Nomic from Hugging Face.\n",
        "- **Store the embeddings in Qdrant**, a vector database running locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a working pipeline that reads documents, encodes them into meaningful vector representations, and persists them in a local database that can be queried later.\n",

Business.\\nOur Mission\\nImprove people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.\\nOverview\\nLyft,  Inc  (the  “Company”  or  “Lyft”)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demand\\nridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States\\nand Canada.\\nWe believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massive\\nsocietal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in select\\ncities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing drivers\\nusing our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is a\\nmassive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.\\nWe are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the\\n“Lyft  Platform”)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  a\\nsignificant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network is\\nwell positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.\\nToday, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”)\\nfor shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want to\\nrent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership.\\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions from\\ndrivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue from\\nriders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive, Lyft Rentals renters, Lyft Driver Center and Lyft Auto Care users, and by making our\\nridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs. In the second\\nquarter of 2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.\\nWe have made focused and substantial investments in support of our mission. For example, to continually launch new innovations on our platform, we have\\ninvested heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,\\ncultivate a differentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerful\\nmultimodal platform and scaled user network.\\nNotwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses. We\\nalso continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-driving\\ntechnology on the Lyft network. Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continue\\nto be well positioned as a leader in TaaS. Even as we invest in the business, we also remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently.\\nTo advance our mission, we aim to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility.\\nWe  believe  that  our  brand  represents  freedom  at  your  fingertips:  freedom  from  the  stresses  of  car  ownership  and  freedom  to  do  and  see  more.  Through  our  LyftUp\\ninitiative, we’re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We are\\nalso proud to be leaders in the fight against climate change. We’ve made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (“EVs”) on the Lyft network by the end of 2030.\\nWe believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility.\\nOur values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services,\\nincluding a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment. As we progress through the COVID-19 recovery, we remain confident the demand for our\\nofferings will continue to grow as more and more people discover and rely on the convenience, experience and affordability of using Lyft.\\n5\\nImpact of COVID-19 to our Business\\nThe  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  impact  communities  in  the  United  States,  Canada  and  globally.  Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,\\ngovernments and private businesses - at the recommendation of public health officials - have enacted precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel\\nrestrictions  and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  home\\nprograms and limited the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for our\\nplatform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19\\npandemic.\\nAlthough we have seen some signs of demand improving, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the pandemic, demand levels continue to be\\naffected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which our operations will continue\\nto be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information\\nwhich may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic\\nor recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused many businesses to delay employees returning to\\nthe  office,  which  in  turn  reduces  levels  of  demand.  Even  as  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders  are  modified  or  lifted,  we  anticipate  that  continued  social\\ndistancing, altered consumer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration of\\nthese challenges cannot be presently estimated.\\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements for\\nridesharing  and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcount\\nreductions in 2020.\\nFor more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I. For\\nmore information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\\nof Operations” in Item 7 of Part II.\\nOur Transportation Network\\nOur transportation network offers riders seamless, personalized and on-demand access to a variety of mobility options.\\n6\\nOur transportation network is comprised of:\\n•\\nRidesharing Marketplace. Our core offering since 2012 connects drivers with riders who need to get somewhere. The scale of our network enables us to predict\\ndemand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers\\nand offer convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in cities\\nacross the United States and in select cities in Canada.\\n•\\nExpress Drive. Our flexible car rentals program for drivers who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements.\\nThrough our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft\\nPlatform.\\n•\\nLyft Rentals. In 2019, we launched Lyft Rentals to offer an attractive option for users who have long-distance trips, such as a weekend away. This is a separate\\nconsumer offering from Express Drive.\\n•\\nLight Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for options\\nthat are more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile and\\nlast-mile of a multimodal trip with public transit.\\n•\\nPublic  Transit. Available  in  select  cities,  our  Transit  offering  integrates  third-party  public  transit  data  into  the  Lyft  App  to  offer  users  a  robust  view  of\\ntransportation options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is another\\nstep toward providing effective, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected transportation network.\\n•\\nLyft Autonomous. We have a number of strategic partnerships that offer access to autonomous vehicles. Our Open Platform partnership with Motional (formerly\\nAptiv) has enabled the commercial deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. In July 2021, we completed a multi-element\\ntransaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5,\\nas well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate the safety and commercialization of the automated-driving\\nvehicles that Woven Planet is developing. In December 2021, we launched an autonomous rideshare service in Miami with Ford and Argo AI, delivering on a\\nshared commitment to deploy Ford’s autonomous vehicles, powered by the Argo Self-Driving System, on our ridesharing network.\\nWe have established one of the largest transportation networks in the United States and Canada. While network scale is important, we recognize that transportation\\nhappens locally and each market has its own unique user network. Our dynamic platform adjusts to the specific attributes of each market on a real-time basis.\\nDrivers\\nThe drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We work\\nhard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to be their own bosses and providing them the opportunity to focus their time on what matters\\nmost. Key benefits to drivers on our platform include:\\n•\\nFlexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.\\n•\\nTechnology. Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to drive to\\nmaximize their earnings on a real-time basis.\\n•\\nInsurance. We procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents while\\non the platform.\\n•\\nCommunity Standards. To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked through\\nthe Lyft App.\\n•\\nSupport. Our Driver Hubs and certain field locations in major cities serve as gathering places and offer in-person support and a personal connection to Lyft\\nemployees. In addition, drivers have access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.\\nRiders\\nRiders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from work,\\nexplore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated, riders are passengers who\\nrequest rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience\\nevery time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation network of choice. Key benefits to riders on our platform include:\\n7\\n•\\nSelection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently matches\\nriders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. Additional modes, such as\\nLight Vehicles, offer riders more options for shorter trips. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized\\nexperiences most suitable to the trip being planned.\\n•\\nAvailability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and riders\\nconnect efficiently and reduce wait times.\\n•\\nAffordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time.\\n•\\nSafety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative products, policies\\nand processes.\\nBusiness\\nLyft is evolving how businesses large and small take care of their people’s transportation needs across sectors including corporate, healthcare, auto, education and\\ngovernment.  Our  comprehensive  set  of  solutions  allows  clients  to  design,  manage  and  pay  for  ground  transportation  programs  that  contribute  to  productivity  and\\nsatisfaction while reducing cost, improving transparency and streamlining operations.\\nOur Technology Infrastructure and Operations\\nWe organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design. We focus\\non  affordability,  reliability,  efficiency,  optimization  and  cohesion  when  developing  our  software.  Our  offerings  are  mobile-first  and  platform  agnostic.  We  seek  to\\ncontinuously improve the Lyft Platform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks in demand.\\nWe have a commercial agreement with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of our partnership, we\\nbelieve we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Our commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until\\nterminated  by  AWS  or  us.  AWS  may  only  terminate  the  agreement  for  convenience  after  January  31,  2026,  and  only  after  complying  with  certain  advance  notice\\nrequirements. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing\\nprior written notice and a 30-day cure period. Under this agreement, we committed to spend an aggregate of at least $300 million between January 2019 and June 2022 on\\nAWS services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the three years. In February 2022, we amended the agreement and committed to spend an aggregate of at\\nleast  $350  million  between  February  2022  and  January  2026,  with  a  minimum  of  $80  million  in  each  of  the  four  years.  If  we  fail  to  meet  the  minimum  purchase\\ncommitment during any year, we may be required to pay the difference. We pay AWS monthly, and we may pay more than the minimum purchase commitment to AWS\\nbased on usage.\\nWe designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Both incremental and full backups are\\nperformed and redundant copies of content are stored independently in separate geographic regions. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our data\\nprivacy and security foundation, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies.\\nOur Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform\\nOur robust technology platform powers the millions of rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform in real-time.\\nWe leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets covering the ride lifecycle,\\nfrom when drivers go online and riders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the rides. Utilizing machine learning capabilities\\nto predict future behavior based on many years of historical data and use cases, we employ various levers to balance supply and demand in the marketplace, creating\\nincreased driver earnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data science and algorithms to inform our product development.\\nOur Intellectual Property\\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license\\nagreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and\\ningenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and offerings are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\\n8\\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in ridesharing, autonomous vehicle-related\\ntechnology, telecommunications, networking and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2021, we held 343 issued U.S. patents and had 310 U.S.\\npatent applications pending. We also held 70 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions and had 143 applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our\\ndevelopment efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the\\nUnited States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks. In addition, we have\\nregistered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.lyft.com and other variations.\\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our\\nintellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled\\n“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Claims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could\\nharm our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Failure  to protect or enforce our intellectual  property rights could harm our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.”\\nOur Growth Strategy\\nTransportation represents a massive market opportunity, one that we are in the very early stages of addressing. Our key growth strategies include our plans to:\\n•\\nIncrease Rider Use Cases. We are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offer\\nproducts to simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services and\\nuniversity safe rides programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizations\\nto manage the transportation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.\\n•\\nGrow Active Riders. We see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. We may make incremental\\ninvestments in our brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We may also offer discounts for first-time riders\\nto try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace by\\nattracting and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand our\\nnetwork coverage beyond the geographies and markets we currently serve. We also believe we are a beneficiary of demographic shifts, such as the growing\\npercentage of the U.S. population that is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.\\n•\\nGrow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft network\\nspans rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliver\\nthe best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.\\n•\\nDeliver  Increasing  Value  to  Drivers. We  strive  to  provide  drivers  that  use  Lyft  with  the  best  possible  experience,  including  access  to  the  best  economic\\nopportunities. For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We’ve also been investing in our\\nDriver  Centers,  Mobile  Services  and  related  partnerships  that  offer  drivers  affordable  and  convenient  vehicle  maintenance  services.  By  making  the  driver\\nexperience better and better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft’s network.\\n•\\nInvest in our Marketplace Technology. Our investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers and\\nriders. Our investments in mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies and data science are key to making our network more efficient\\nand seamless to use.\\n•\\nThoughtfully Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. In November 2018, we acquired Bikeshare Holdings LLC (“Motivate”), the largest bike sharing platform in\\nthe United States at the time and in February 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, LLC (“Flexdrive”), one of our longstanding Express Drive partners. We will continue\\nto selectively consider acquisitions that contribute to the growth of our current business, help us expand into adjacent markets or add new capabilities to our\\nnetwork. We believe drivers and riders will continue to benefit from a broad partner ecosystem that builds on our existing loyalty and reward programs. We have\\nalso built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and local governments, and technology solutions providers and we intend to continue to pursue\\npartnerships that contribute to our growth.\\nCompetition\\nThe market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of new\\nservices and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new\\n9\\nentrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these\\ncompetitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation\\nthat could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Canada include Uber and Via. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market include\\nLime and Bird. Our main competitors in the consumer vehicle rental market include Enterprise, Hertz and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces.\\nWe also compete with certain non-ridesharing transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers.\\nAdditionally,  there  are  other  non-U.S.-based  TaaS  network  companies,  non-ridesharing  transportation  network  companies  and  traditional  automotive\\nmanufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada, such as BMW, which has an ongoing presence in the transportation network market in Europe. There are\\nalso a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple,\\nAurora, Baidu and General Motors (Cruise) as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges\\nfrom current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.\\nWe believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer\\noperating  histories,  larger  marketing  budgets  and  established  marketing  relationships,  access  to  larger  customer  bases  and  significantly  greater  resources  for  the\\ndevelopment of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to\\nOperational Factors—We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.”\\nSeasonality\\nThe revenue we generate from our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays. We expect the\\ndemand for our transportation network may decline over the winter season and the demand for our network of Light Vehicles may increase during more temperate and dry\\nseasons. Our business is also subject to risks related to COVID-19. In particular, travel bans and mobility restrictions have weighed on demand. Although we have seen\\nsome signs of demand improving as COVID-19 conditions have improved, particularly compared to the start of the pandemic, the exact timing and pace of the recovery\\nremain uncertain. We are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be eased, how riders will respond to the easing of such\\nmeasures, as well as whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future, any of which may continue to result in decreased demand notwithstanding\\nusual seasonality.\\nOur Brand and Marketing\\nWe believe good energy moves the world. The Lyft brand is rooted in our hospitality principles: safety, simplicity, reliability, care, and delight. Our marketing\\nefforts bring our brand to life across a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct communications like email and social\\nmedia engagement. We also benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider community\\nOur marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential drivers and\\nriders. Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships, sponsored local events,\\nand outdoor advertisements.\\nWe use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend. We attract new drivers and riders through referrals, partnerships,\\ndisplay advertising, radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more. We continue to engage with current riders through\\na variety of initiatives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.\\nOur Commitment to Safety\\nA strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with drivers and\\nriders on our platform, and we take significant measures every day that are focused on their safety.\\nTo ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding high quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC (formerly\\nknown as Customer Experience and Trust), team as a key part of our organization. With over 300 employees as of December 31, 2021, SCC is in charge of fielding safety\\nand customer support inquiries and is available through multiple channels, including via self-service and assisted support directly within our apps. Our SCC team focuses\\non driving results based on experience-based metrics including First Contact Resolution, which is the number of support tickets resolved during first contact with a driver or\\nrider, and Net Promoter Score. SCC aims to eliminate bad customer experiences, quickly resolve problems when they occur and maintain trust with drivers and riders. This\\ndedication led our customer support to be recently named number one in Newsweek’s 2021 America’s Best Customer Service rankings for the Taxi and Ridesharing\\ncategory.\\n10\\nSome measures we take to promote the safety of riders and drivers on the platform include:\\n•\\nAnnual background checks. Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered background check before they drive and each year after that.\\n•\\nOngoing criminal monitoring. Continuous criminal monitoring allows us to quickly deactivate drivers with disqualifying criminal convictions. We also check\\ndriving records throughout the year to promptly identify and remove disqualified drivers from the platform as soon as a violation is detected.\\n•\\nMandatory safety education. Drivers must complete a safety program developed with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in North America.\\nThese  programs  can  vary  by  state  and  cover  topics  such  as  how  to  create  a  safe  and  comfortable  ride,  appropriate  conversation  topics,  respecting  personal\\nboundaries, and recognizing and reporting sexual assault and sexual misconduct.\\n•\\nEmergency help, supported by ADT. If a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with an\\nADT security professional.\\n•\\nHidden contact information and ride history. The Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride. While riders\\nand drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, including real user phone numbers, are not revealed. Drivers are also not able\\nto see a rider’s drop-off location, whether it’s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.\\n•\\nTwo-way ratings and mandatory feedback. At the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider or\\ndriver who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details. Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will never be\\nmatched with that individual again through the app.\\nIn 2021, we published our Community Safety Report, which is available on our website and details the frequency of some of the most serious safety incidents that\\nare reported to us, which are statistically very rare. From 2017 to 2019, over 99% of trips occurred without any reported safety incident, which accounted for 0.0002% of all\\ntrips in this period. However, while safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we recognize that behind every report is a real person and real experience, and our\\ngoal is to make each Lyft ride as safe as we possibly can.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as\\nTNCs, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality\\nobligations,  product  liability,  defects,  recalls,  auto  maintenance  and  repairs,  personal  injury,  text  messaging,  subscription  services,  intellectual  property,  securities,\\nconsumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions,\\nterms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical\\ntransportation, healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-\\nbribery, political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and\\ndelivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many\\ncases  due  to  their  lack  of  specificity.  As  a  result,  their  application  in  practice  may  change  or  develop  over  time  through  judicial  decisions  or  as  new  guidance  or\\ninterpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\\nThe TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specifically\\nincreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, California passed first-of-its-kind  legislation (the “California Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program”) to\\nmandate that TNCs reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis, with additional requirements that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission\\nvehicles on their platforms. Policymakers recently proposed analogous legislation in Washington and Oregon. Other states are actively observing the California Clean\\nMiles Standard and Incentive Program as well.\\nSee the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the subsections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Challenges to contractor\\nclassification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to\\nRegulatory and Legal Factors—Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and\\nregulations could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operational Factors—We rely on third-party payment\\nprocessors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such third parties and other\\npayment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal\\nFactors—Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply\\nwith such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could\\n11\\nadversely affect our business”, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—We face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages\\nsent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Climate change may have a long-term\\nimpact on our business” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.\\nHuman Capital\\nOur employees are our human capital and they are our greatest strength and most valuable resource. As of December 31, 2021, we had 4,453 employees in\\napproximately 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks. Approximately 40% of our employees work in our product\\nmanagement, engineering, design and science organizations. Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.\\nWe believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more our\\nemployees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2021, our employee base was 59%\\nmale and 39% female, and women represented 37% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx,\\n8% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is based\\non  self-identification,  and  employees  who  did  not  disclose  their  gender  or  ethnicity  have  been  excluded  from  the  applicable  disclosure.  As  of  December  31,  2021,\\nemployees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% of\\ntotal U.S. employees.\\nWe strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, develop\\ntalent internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We launched initiatives such as requiring all director level and above roles to consider at least one woman and\\none  Black  or  Latinx  candidate  at  the  onsite  interview  stage.  We  are  continuing  to  focus  on  scaling  and  sustaining  diverse  partnerships  and  early  candidate  pipeline\\ndevelopment as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization.\\nOne of the most powerful examples of Lyft’s devotion to inclusivity is our ongoing commitment to pay fairness. We conducted an annual pay equity audit for our\\nfifth consecutive year to assess for any systemic issues in our compensation. We worked with third party experts to conduct statistical tests on a majority of U.S. based team\\nmembers’ annual salary, equity awards, and total compensation at hire. The goal was to identify whether any statistically significant pay differences existed between\\ndifferent demographic (gender and race) groups in the same band, level and job family. Where our analysis identified differences, we investigated, including looking at\\nfactors not accounted for in the statistical models we used. In 2021, we did not find patterns of statistically significant pay differences for different gender or racial groups\\nafter accounting for legitimate business factors like performance, experience, and location.\\nGiven continued uncertainty and as we recognize our remote work policy must be broadened, we have given many employees the option to work from home.\\nNone of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.\\nIn December 2020, we released our 2020 Inclusion, Diversity and Racial Equity Report, which is available on our website. We have presented this report since\\n2017 and intend to continue to present this report to make available certain information about our diversity and inclusion efforts.\\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\\nIn May 2021, we released our 2021 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report, which is available on our website. We began publishing this report\\nin 2020 and intend to continue to prepare this report annually to make available key information about our work toward environmental, social, and economic issues.\\nEnvironmental\\nLyft was founded on the belief that technology will enable us to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from the transportation system. Our vision is to rebuild\\ncities around people by offering seamless access through the Lyft App to on-demand rides, public transit, and car rentals as well as lower-carbon micromobility modes. As\\nanother step in the shift from personal car ownership, we’ve also launched Lyft Pink, our premier membership program, which offers discounted pricing for rideshare,\\nbikes, and scooters, in addition to perks for car rentals.\\nWe launched our national Resilient Streets Initiative in September 2020 and offered a vision for how cities can safely and efficiently move the greatest number of\\npeople as economic, educational and social activities resume in our cities. The initiative reimagined what a “resilient street corridor” might look like in cities where Lyft\\noperates micromobility services. It also investigated the impact of street design on key metrics around vehicle miles traveled, socioeconomic demographics and GHG\\nemissions.\\n12\\nBecause we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft made the commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030.\\nBy working with drivers to transition to EVs, we have the potential to avoid tens of millions of metric tons of GHG emissions to the atmosphere and to reduce gasoline\\nconsumption  by  more  than  a  billion  gallons  over  the  next  decade.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program  which  was  approved  by  the\\nCalifornia Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that ninety percent of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. The shift to 100%\\nEVs will mean transitioning all vehicles used on the Lyft platform over the next decade to all-electric or other zero-emission technologies. This includes cars in Express\\nDrive, Lyft Rentals, Lyft Autonomous, and personal cars used by drivers on the Lyft platform. Switching to EVs is not just good for the planet; it’s good for people – riders,\\ndrivers, and the communities they serve.\\nSocial\\nWe approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust,\\nrespect and a common objective of improving people’s lives by improving transportation. Through our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to enable access to affordable,\\nreliable transportation for all — no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most serious\\noutstanding transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access to\\nfree and discounted car, bike and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. LyftUp programs included:\\n•\\nJobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;\\n•\\nGrocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;\\n•\\nCommunity Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyperlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;\\n•\\nMicromobility  Access -  provides  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter-share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal,  state  or  local\\nassistance programs;\\n•\\nUniversal Vaccine Access Campaign - mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsured\\nand at-risk communities;\\n•\\nDisaster Response - provides rides to access vital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so;\\nand\\n•\\nVoting Access - provides rides to the polls during Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such as\\nseniors, veterans and communities of color.\\nIn response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (“SB8”) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created a\\nDriver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood to\\nhelp ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Similarly, riders\\nshould never have to justify or share where they are going or why.\\nCorporate Governance\\nOur board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company\\'s direction and ensure it is operating with\\nthe utmost business integrity. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement for our\\n2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\\nCorporate Information\\nWe were incorporated in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In 2008, we changed our name to Zimride, Inc. We founded Lyft in 2012 and\\nchanged our name to Lyft, Inc. in 2013 when we sold the assets related to our Zimride operations.\\n13\\nAvailable Information\\nOur website is located at www.lyft.com, and our investor relations website is located at investor.lyft.com.

business, financial condition and results of operations. We\\nare unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations\\nand the achievement of our strategic objectives.\\nOur business, operations and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, such\\nas travel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. The pandemic and these related responses continue to evolve and have caused, and are expected to continue to\\ncause, decreased demand for our platform relative to pre-COVID-19 demand, disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial\\nmarkets.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, those\\ndiscussed below:\\n•\\nDeclines in travel as a result of COVID-19, including commuting, local travel, and business and leisure travel, have resulted in decreased demand for our platform\\nwhich has decreased our revenues. These factors have in the past and may continue to lead to a decrease in earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. We\\npaused our shared rides offerings as a result of COVID-19, but relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021. While certain types\\nof  travel  have  begun  to  increase  compared  to  earlier  periods  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  overall  levels  remain  depressed  and  changes  in  travel  trends  and\\nbehavior arising from COVID-19, including as a result of new strains of COVID-19, may continue to develop or persist over time and further contribute to this\\nadverse effect.\\n•\\nChanges in driver behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to reduced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider demand in certain\\nmarkets. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability is limited, our service levels have been and may be negatively\\nimpacted and we have increased prices or provided additional incentives and may need to continue to do so, which may adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operation.\\n•\\nThe responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to modify our business practices by permitting corporate employees in nearly all of our\\nlocations  to  work  remotely,  limiting  employee  travel,  and  canceling,  postponing  or  holding  virtual  events  and  meetings.  We  may  be  required  to  or  choose\\nvoluntarily to take additional actions for the health and safety of our workforce and users of our platform, including after the pandemic subsides and with respect\\nto vaccination, whether in response to government orders or based on our own determinations of what is in the best interests of our employees or users of our\\nplatform. The effects of the pandemic, including permanent hybrid and remote working arrangements for employees, may also impact our real estate footprint,\\nfinancial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and may increase the risk of a cybersecurity breach or incident. To\\nthe extent these measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our financial\\nstatements or maintain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n•\\nWe design and contract to manufacture Light Vehicles using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of Light\\nVehicles that meet our standards is critical to our operations. We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of shared Light\\nVehicles and we rely on a small number of suppliers for components and manufacturing services. We have faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic\\nrelated  to  these  assets,  such  as  delays  in  their  manufacture  and  delivery  and  increased  costs  associated  with  manufacturing  and  shipping,  and  we  may  face\\nadditional challenges in future periods. These challenges may adversely affect our ability to deploy new Light Vehicles on our network or to implement new\\nfeatures on our network of Light Vehicles. These supply chain issues have and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\n•\\nThe impacts of COVID-19 have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the demand for vehicles rented to drivers through our Express Drive program,\\nand for the fleet rented to users through Lyft Rentals. Further, COVID-19 has and may continue to negatively impact Lyft’s ability to conduct rental operations\\nthrough the Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals as a result of restrictions on travel, mandated closures, limited staffing availability, and other factors related\\nto COVID-19. For example, in 2020, Lyft Rentals temporarily ceased operations, closing its rental locations, as a result of COVID-19. Further, while Express\\nDrive rental periods renew on a weekly basis, new rental reservations were temporarily blocked in 2020, and subsequently re-opened with modified operations to\\nlimit the proximity and amount of interactions between associates and drivers, and to address additional cleaning which may be required as a result of COVID-19.\\nThese operations are more costly, and vulnerable to shortages of cleaning supplies or other materials required to operate rental sites while minimizing the risk of\\nexposure to COVID-19. As a result of the adverse impact to demand for rides on the rideshare platform, drivers renting through the Express Drive program have\\nhad and may continue to have a diminished ability to pay their rental fees. In response, in 2020, Flexdrive temporarily reduced pricing for Flexdrive rentals in\\ncities most affected by COVID-19, which has since been reversed. In 2020, Flexdrive also began to waive rental fees for drivers who are confirmed to have tested\\npositive for COVID-19 or requested to quarantine by a medical professional, which it continues to do at this time. Further, Lyft Rentals and Flexdrive have faced\\nsignificantly higher costs in transporting, repossessing, cleaning, and\\n17\\nstoring unrented and returned vehicles. These impacts to the demand for and operations of the different rental programs have and may continue to adversely affect\\nour business, financial condition and results of operation.\\n•\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may delay or prevent us, or our current or prospective partners and suppliers, from being able to test, develop or deploy autonomous\\nvehicle-related  technology,  including  through  direct  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  virus  on  employee  and  contractor  health;  reduced  consumer  demand  for\\nautonomous vehicle travel resulting from an overall reduced demand for travel; shelter-in-place orders by local, state or federal governments negatively impacting\\noperations, including our ability to test autonomous vehicle-related technology; impacts to the supply chains of our current or prospective partners and suppliers;\\nor economic  impacts  limiting  our or  our current  or prospective  partners’  or  suppliers’  ability  to expend  resources  on  developing  and  deploying  autonomous\\nvehicle-related  technology.  These  impacts  to  the  development  and  deployment  of  autonomous  vehicle-related  technology  may  adversely  affect  our  business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\n•\\nIn response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we have had to take certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs, furloughs and salary\\nreductions, which may have adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees. As the severity, magnitude and duration\\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health responses, and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic’s\\nimpact on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remains\\nuncertain and difficult to predict. As the pandemic continues, the recovery of the economy and our business have fluctuated and varied by geography. Further, the\\nultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our users, customers, employees, business, operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are\\nnot within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the\\npandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and modified workplace activities); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response thereto on\\nlocal  or  regional  economies,  travel  and  economic  activity;  the  speed  and  efficacy  of  vaccine  distribution;  the  availability  of  government  funding  programs;\\nevolving laws and regulations regarding COVID-19, including those related to disclosure, notification and pricing; general economic uncertainty in key markets\\nand financial market volatility; volatility in our stock price, global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; the duration of the pandemic; the extent of\\nany virus mutations or new strains of COVID-19; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\\n•\\nIn light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financial\\nand operating results.\\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.\\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile networks, the\\nInternet or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for\\nseismic activity and increasingly for fires. The impact of climate change may increase these risks. In addition, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,\\nother epidemics, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political or social instability and other geopolitical developments, or other catastrophic events,\\nwhether in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. For example, we have offices and employees in Belarus and\\nUkraine that are expected to be adversely affected by the current conflict in the region. The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or our\\nthird-party providers’ abilities could result in decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.\\nA deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nOur business and results of operations are also subject to global economic conditions, including any resulting effect on spending by us or riders. A deterioration of\\ngeneral macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or recession, inflation, changes to fuel and other energy costs or vehicle costs, or decreases in consumer\\nspending power or confidence may harm our results of operations. Economic weakness or uncertainty, and constrained consumer spending have in the past resulted in, and\\nmay in the future result in, decreased revenues and earnings. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively\\naffect our ability to make decisions about future investments. In addition, economic instability or uncertainty, and other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19\\npandemic, have, and may continue to, put pressure on economic conditions, which has led and could lead, to reduced demand for services on our platform or greater\\noperating  expenses. For  example,  inflation  has  broadly  impacted  the  auto  service  industry,  which  has  increased  our  insurance  costs.  If  general  economic  conditions\\ndeteriorate in the United States or in other markets where we operate, discretionary spending may decline and demand for ridesharing may be reduced. An economic\\ndownturn resulting in a prolonged recessionary period may have a further adverse effect on our revenue.\\n18\\nRisks Related to Operational Factors\\nOur limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\\nWhile we have primarily focused on ridesharing since our ridesharing marketplace launched in 2012, our business continues to evolve. We regularly expand our\\nplatform features, offerings and services and change our pricing methodologies. In recent periods, we have also reevaluated and changed our cost structure and focused our\\nbusiness model. Our evolving business, industry and markets make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks and\\nchallenges we have faced or expect to face include our ability to:\\n•\\nforecast our revenue and budget for and manage our expenses;\\n•\\nattract new qualified drivers and new riders and retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders in a cost-effective manner;\\n•\\ncomply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;\\n•\\nmanage our platform and our business assets and expenses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures issued by various jurisdictions,\\nincluding travel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders, as well as maintain demand for and confidence in the safety of our platform during and\\nfollowing the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n•\\nplan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future offerings, including our network of Light Vehicles or certain vehicles in the Express Drive\\nprogram and the fleet of vehicles for Lyft Rentals, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future offerings;\\n•\\ndevelop, manufacture, source, deploy, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles, Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, Mobile\\nServices, Lyft Auto Care, certain vehicles in the Express Drive program, vehicles for Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle technology;\\n•\\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\\n•\\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\\n•\\neffectively manage our growth and business operations, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business;\\n•\\nsuccessfully expand our geographic reach;\\n•\\nhire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\\n•\\nsuccessfully develop new platform features, offerings and services to enhance the experience of users; and\\n•\\nright-size our real estate portfolio.\\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this\\n“Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have an evolving financial model and\\noperate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a static financial model or\\noperated in a more predictable  market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties  frequently  experienced  by growing\\ncompanies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our\\nbusiness, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\\nPrior to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined significantly and\\nwe have since recovered partially, but our revenue remains below pre-COVID levels and the timeline for a full recovery is uncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenue\\ngrowth rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the decline related to COVID-19 and recent growth rates compared to periods in the\\nmidst of the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, although we have achieved Adjusted EBITDA profitability in\\neach of the last three quarters, we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain Adjusted\\nEBITDA profitability in the future, on a quarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.\\n19\\nOur expenses will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform features, expand in existing and new markets and continue to\\ninvest in our platform and customer engagement, or as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in\\nincreased revenue or growth in our business. For example, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional  costs and expenses associated  with the passage of\\nProposition 22 in California including providing drivers in California with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards healthcare coverage,\\noccupational accident insurance and minimum guaranteed earnings, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, including sales, marketing and costs relating to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we have expanded over\\ntime to include more asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals and Lyft Auto Care. We are also expanding the support\\navailable to drivers at our Driver Hubs, our driver-centric service centers and community spaces, Driver Centers, our vehicle service centers, Mobile Services, Lyft Auto\\nCare, and through our Express Drive vehicle rental program. In addition, we have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our\\nplatform by the end of 2030. These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation,\\nasset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, our\\ninvestments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, any\\nlegal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (including\\npotentially suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our\\nbusiness, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and other equity awards may continue to be a significant expense in future\\nperiods, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $587.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will be\\nrecognized  over a weighted-average  period of approximately  1.7 years. Any failure  to  increase  our revenue sufficiently  to  keep pace with our  investments  and other\\nexpenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and\\nchallenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nAs our business recovers from the effects of COVID-19 and we endeavor to return to pre-COVID financial performance, our revenue growth rates and results of\\noperations will fluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, slowing demand for our offerings,\\nincreasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or market saturation, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our business\\nmodel and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur\\nsignificant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\\nWe face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nThe market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of new\\nservices and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater\\nresources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position\\ncould weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results\\nof operations.\\nOur main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Canada include Uber and Via. Our main competitors in bike and scooter sharing include Lime and Bird.\\nOur main competitors in consumer vehicle rentals include Enterprise, Hertz and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces. We also compete with\\ncertain non-ridesharing transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers.\\nAdditionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, bike and scooter sharing companies, consumer vehicle rental companies, non-ridesharing\\ntransportation network companies and traditional automotive manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada, such as BMW, which has an ongoing\\npresence in the transportation network market in Europe. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with us in the\\nfuture, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple, Aurora, Baidu and General Motors (Cruise) as well as many other technology companies and automobile\\nmanufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.\\nCertain of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, research and development, manufacturing and other resources,\\ngreater name recognition, longer operating histories or a larger user base than we do. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale\\nof offerings and offer lower prices than we do, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, they may have greater resources to deploy towards the\\nresearch, development and commercialization of new technologies, including autonomous vehicle technology or Light Vehicles, or they may have other financial, technical\\nor resource advantages. These factors may allow our competitors or potential competitors to derive greater revenue and\\n20\\nprofits from their existing user bases, attract and retain qualified drivers and riders at lower costs or respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and trends.\\nOur current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative or strategic relationships, or consolidate, amongst themselves or with third parties that may further\\nenhance their resources and offerings.\\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\\n•\\nthe popularity, utility, ease of use, performance and reliability of our offerings compared to those of our competitors;\\n•\\nour reputation, including the perceived safety of our platform, and brand strength relative to our competitors;\\n•\\nour pricing models and the prices of our offerings and the fees we charge drivers on our platform;\\n•\\nour ability, and our ability compared to our competitors, to manage our business and operations during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recovery as well as\\nin  response  to  related  governmental,  business  and  individuals’  actions  that  continue  to  evolve  (including  restrictions  on  travel  and  transport  and  modified\\nworkplace activities);\\n•\\nour ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders;\\n•\\nour ability, and our ability compared to our competitors, to develop new offerings;\\n•\\nour ability to establish and maintain relationships with partners;\\n•\\nour ability to develop, manufacture, source, deploy, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles, Driver Hubs, Driver\\nCenters, Mobile Services, Lyft Auto Care, certain vehicles in the Express Drive program, vehicles for Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle technology, including\\nthe success of any strategic options we may consider with regard to our assets;\\n•\\nchanges mandated by, or that we elect to make, to address legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements, judgments, injunctions and consent\\ndecrees, including those related to the classification of drivers on our platform;\\n•\\nour ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees;\\n•\\nour ability to raise additional capital as needed; and\\n•\\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry.\\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur results of operations vary and are unpredictable from period-to-period, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of reasons,\\nmany of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, the\\nresults of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that may cause our results of operations\\nto fluctuate in this “Risk Factors” section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections, or the\\nexpectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\\nThe ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, are still in relatively early stages of growth and development and\\nif such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nPrior to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow,\\nparticularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is new and unproven, and it is\\nuncertain whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the\\nwillingness of people to widely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings. We cannot be certain whether the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact the\\nwillingness of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or the willingness of riders to use shared bikes or scooters. In addition, we paused our shared rides offerings\\n(though we relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021), and we were temporarily restricted from operating our bike share and scooter\\nshare programs in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently temporarily suspended\\nrentals of scooters due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. Although the scooter rental suspension was lifted in February 2021, in the event of a resurgence of\\nCOVID-19, we may be required or believe it is advisable to suspend such offerings again. If the public\\n21\\ndoes not perceive ridesharing or our other offerings as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding public health or safety, affordability or for\\nother reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms, the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, then the market for our offerings\\nmay not further develop, may develop more slowly than we expect or may not achieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluate\\nthe markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain\\nmarkets as a result of such evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations could be harmed.\\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and to\\nincrease utilization of our platform by existing drivers. To attract and retain qualified drivers, we have, among other things, offered sign-up and referral bonuses and\\nprovided access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. If we do not continue to provide drivers with\\nflexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income and other incentive programs, such as volume-based discounts and performance-based bonuses, that are\\ncomparable or superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits or\\nour requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilization\\nof our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example,\\nduring the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activities\\nand visiting business venues were or have been eased. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offer\\nincreased incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have been\\nable to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, or\\ndrivers may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increase\\nour  expenses.  Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  This\\nincludes  a  lawsuit  seeking  to  overturn  Proposition  22  in  California,  where  a  lower-court  judge  issued  an  order  on  August  20,  2021  finding  that  Proposition  22  is\\nunenforceable (which order is now on appeal with Proposition 22 remaining in effect during the appeal). If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we may\\nbe  required  to  classify  drivers  as  employees  rather  than  independent  contractors  in  those  jurisdictions.  If  this  occurs,  we  may  need  to  develop  and  implement  an\\nemployment model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risks\\nrelating to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employee\\ndrivers to meet rider demand.\\nIf drivers are unsatisfied with our partners, including our third-party vehicle rental partners, our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our\\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to attract drivers\\ncould fail to attract and retain qualified drivers or fail to increase utilization by existing drivers, or could have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes\\nin certain laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool of\\nqualified drivers, which may result in increased competition for qualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and retention. As part of our business operations\\nor research and development efforts, data on the vehicle may be collected and drivers may be uncomfortable or unwilling to drive knowing that data is being collected.\\nOther factors outside of our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other concerns about personal health and safety, increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles or\\ninsurance, or concerns about the availability of government or other assistance programs if drivers continue to drive on our platform, may also reduce the number of drivers\\non our platform or utilization of our platform by drivers, or impact our ability to onboard new drivers. If we fail to attract qualified drivers on favorable terms, fail to\\nincrease utilization of our platform by existing drivers or lose qualified drivers to our competitors, we may not be able to meet the demand of riders, including maintaining a\\ncompetitive price of rides to riders, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract new riders, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing riders, our business, financial condition and results of operations\\ncould be harmed.\\nOur success depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract new riders, retain existing riders and increase utilization of our platform by current riders.\\nRiders have a wide variety of options for transportation, including personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit and other ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing\\nofferings.  Rider preferences  may  also change  from time  to  time.  To expand  our rider  base, we must  appeal  to  new riders who have historically  used other forms  of\\ntransportation or other ridesharing or bike and scooter sharing platforms. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our\\nofferings,  which in  turn drives  new rider  growth and rider  utilization.  However, our  reputation,  brand and  ability  to  build trust  with existing  and new riders  may  be\\nadversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our offerings, our policies, including our pricing algorithms, drivers on our platform, or our competitors,\\neven if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Further,\\n22\\nif existing and new riders do not perceive the transportation services provided by drivers on our platform to be reliable, safe and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and\\nrelevant offerings and features on our platform, we may not be able to attract or retain riders or to increase their utilization of our platform. As we continue to expand into\\nnew geographic areas, we will be relying in part on referrals from our existing riders to attract new riders, and therefore we must ensure that our existing riders remain\\nsatisfied with our offerings. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience seasonality in both ridesharing and Light Vehicle rentals during the winter\\nmonths, which may harm our ability to attract and retain riders during such periods. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased and may continue to affect utilization\\nof our platform by riders, including longer term. If we fail to continue to grow our rider base, retain existing riders or increase the overall utilization of our platform by\\nexisting riders, we may not be able to provide drivers with an adequate level of ride requests, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected. In addition, if we do not achieve sufficient utilization of our asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Rentals vehicles,\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely substantially on our wholly-owned subsidiary and deductibles to insure auto-related risks and on third-party insurance policies to insure and reinsure our\\noperations-related risks. If our insurance or reinsurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their\\nobligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nFrom the time a driver becomes available to accept rides in the Lyft Driver App until the driver logs off and is no longer available to accept rides, we, through our\\nwholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary  and  deductibles,  often  bear  substantial  financial  risk  with  respect  to  auto-related  incidents,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and\\nunderinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain\\nlimits. To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related risks, we procure a number of third-party insurance\\npolicies which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, of\\nthe auto-related risk from some third-party insurance providers. In connection with our reinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds into trust accounts with a\\nthird-party financial institution from which some third-party insurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as of\\nDecember 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. If we fail to comply with state insurance regulatory requirements or other\\nregulations  governing  insurance  coverage,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  any  of  our  third-party  insurance\\nproviders or administrators who handle the claim on behalf of the third-party insurance providers become insolvent, they could be unable to pay any operations-related\\nclaims that we make.\\nWe also procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including employment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business\\ninterruptions,  cybersecurity  and  data  breaches,  crime,  directors’  and  officers’  liability  and  general  business  liabilities,  including  product  liability.  For  certain  types  of\\noperations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, such as a scaled network of autonomous vehicles, we may not be able to, or may choose\\nnot to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving\\nofferings, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurance or reinsurance\\nproviders becomes insolvent, it could be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Certain losses may be excluded from insurance coverage including, but\\nnot limited to losses caused by intentional act, pollution, contamination, virus, bacteria, terrorism, war and civil unrest.\\nThe amount of one or more auto-related claims or operations-related claims has exceeded and could continue to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits,\\nfor which we have borne and could continue to bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured retentions or otherwise\\npaid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many types of claims, coverages and for a variety of commercial risks and\\nare likely to do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our\\npolicies are renewed or replaced to manage pricing pressure. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) cost per claim,\\npremiums or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers\\nfail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, (v) the number of claims and average claim cost under our deductibles or\\nself-insured retentions differs from historic averages or (vi) an insurance policy is cancelled or non-renewed.\\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe  establish  insurance  reserves  for  claims  incurred  but  not  yet  paid  and  claims  incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  related  estimable  expenses,  and  we\\nperiodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions and insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ\\nvarious  predictive  modeling  and  actuarial  techniques  and  make  numerous  assumptions  based  on  limited  historical  experience  and  industry  statistics  to  estimate  our\\ninsurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective and speculative.\\nWhile an independent actuary firm periodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness and provides claims reserve valuations, a number of external factors can affect the\\nactual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open, fluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory\\ndevelopments, judicial developments and unexpected\\n23\\nevents such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such factors can impact the reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the\\nreserves for claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. Additionally, we have encountered in the past, and\\nmay encounter in the future, instances of insurance fraud, which could increase our actual insurance-related costs. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for\\nclaims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determine\\nthat our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an increase to our\\nnet loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the adverse development to\\ninsurance reserves we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2021 was largely attributable to historical auto losses that are associated with accident liabilities between 2018\\nand 2020.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers for our auto-related insurance claims, and if such providers fail to service insurance claims to\\nour expectations or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers to service our auto-related claims. If any of our third-party insurance service providers fails\\nto service claims to our expectations, discontinues or increases the cost of coverage or changes the terms of such coverage in a manner not favorable to drivers or to us, we\\ncannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage or services on reasonable terms in an acceptable time frame or at all. If we cannot find alternate\\nthird-party insurance service providers on terms acceptable to us, we may incur additional expenses related to servicing such auto-related claims using internal resources.\\nWe may, from time to time, explore the possibility of selling portions of retained insurance risk to third-parties. This may cause us to incur additional expenses in\\nthe total cost of this risk. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we entered into a Novation Agreement to transfer nearly all of our primary auto insurance\\nliabilities related to periods preceding October 2018 to a third-party, in October 2020, we expanded our rideshare insurance program to include additional third-party\\ninsurance-service  providers,  and  in  April  2021,  we  executed  an  agreement  to  reinsure  our  captive  insurance  entity  for  $183  million  of  coverage  above  the  insurance\\nliabilities recorded as of March 31, 2021 for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020. We are subject to recapture of the risk if our\\nthird party reinsurer were to default on their reinsurance obligation.\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party insurance service providers could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead to\\nincreased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur reputation, brand and the network effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are important to our success, and if we are not able to maintain and\\ncontinue developing our reputation, brand and network effects, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand as a safe, reliable and affordable platform and continuing to increase the strength of the network effects\\namong the drivers and riders on our platform are critical to our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders. The successful development of our reputation, brand\\nand network effects will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Negative perception of our platform or company may harm our reputation,\\nbrand and networks effects, including as a result of:\\n•\\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, drivers on our platform, riders, our product offerings, pricing or our policies and guidelines, including our practices and\\npolicies with respect to drivers, or the ridesharing industry, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents;\\n•\\nillegal, negligent, reckless or otherwise inappropriate behavior by drivers or riders or third parties;\\n•\\na failure to provide drivers with a sufficient level of ride requests, charge drivers competitive fees and commissions or provide drivers with competitive fares and\\nincentives;\\n•\\na failure to offer riders competitive ride pricing and pick-up times;\\n•\\na failure to provide a range of ride types sought by riders;\\n•\\nconcerns by riders or drivers about the safety of ridesharing and our platform;\\n•\\nactual or perceived disruptions of or defects in our platform, such as privacy or data security breaches or incidents, site outages, payment disruptions or other\\nincidents that impact the reliability of our offerings;\\n•\\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform or our business;\\n•\\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\\n24\\n•\\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear or inconsistent with our values or mission or that are not clearly articulated;\\n•\\na failure to detect a defect in our Lyft Autonomous technology or our Light Vehicles;\\n•\\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair and transparent;\\n•\\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our stated values and mission;\\n•\\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support service experiences;\\n•\\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\\n•\\nnegative responses by drivers or riders to new offerings on our platform;\\n•\\naccidents, defects or other negative incidents involving autonomous vehicles or Light Vehicles on our platform;\\n•\\nperception of our treatment of employees and our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\\n•\\nmodification or discontinuation of our community or sustainability programs;\\n•\\npolitical or social policies or activities; or\\n•\\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects the public’s perception of us or our industry as a\\nwhole.\\nIf we do not successfully maintain and develop our brand, reputation and network effects and successfully differentiate our offerings from competitive offerings,\\nour business may not grow, we may not be able to compete effectively and we could lose existing qualified drivers or existing riders or fail to attract new qualified drivers\\nor new riders, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes we may make to enhance and improve\\nour offerings and balance the needs and interests of the drivers and riders on our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective (such as riders) but\\nnegatively from another’s perspective (such as drivers), or may not be viewed positively by either drivers or riders. If we fail to balance the interests of drivers and riders or\\nmake changes that they view negatively, drivers and riders may stop using our platform, take fewer rides or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely affect\\nour reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIllegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activity of users, whether or not occurring while utilizing our platform, could expose us to liability and harm our business,\\nbrand, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIllegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities by users, including the activities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then\\nreceiving or providing services offered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating users of our platform could adversely affect our brand,\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. These activities may include assault, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of\\nrider or driver accounts and other misconduct. While we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify and address the risk of these types of activities,\\nthese  measures  may  not  adequately  address,  and  are  unlikely  to  prevent,  all  illegal,  improper  or  otherwise  inappropriate  activity  by  these  parties  from  occurring  in\\nconnection with our offerings. Such conduct could expose us to liability or adversely affect our brand or reputation. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to\\nguard against these illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all drivers undergo annual background checks or our two-way rating\\nsystem and related policies, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent qualified drivers and riders otherwise in good standing from using our offerings, or if we are unable\\nto implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the growth and retention of the number of qualified drivers\\nand riders on our platform and their utilization of our platform could be negatively impacted. Further, any negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident\\noccurred on our platform, on our competitors’  platforms,  or on any ridesharing  platform, could adversely affect  our reputation  and brand or public perception  of the\\nridesharing industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the\\nforegoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential and existing drivers, and if such providers fail to provide accurate information, or if providers\\nare  unable  to  complete  background  checks  because  of  data  access  restrictions,  court  closures  or  other  unforeseen  government  shutdown, or  we  do  not  maintain\\nbusiness relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen the records of potential and existing drivers to help identify those that are not qualified to utilize our\\nplatform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards. Our business has been and may\\n25\\ncontinue to be adversely affected to the extent we cannot attract or retain qualified drivers as a result of such providers being unable to complete certain background checks\\nbecause  of  data  access  restrictions,  court  closures  or  other  government  shutdowns  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  or  to  the  extent  that  they  do  not  meet  their\\ncontractual  obligations,  our  expectations  or  the  requirements  of  applicable  law  or  regulations.  If  any  of  our  third-party  background  check  providers  terminates  its\\nrelationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure\\nsimilar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may\\nnot be able to timely onboard potential drivers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the background checks conducted by our\\nthird-party background check providers do not meet our expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, unqualified drivers may be permitted to\\nprovide rides on our platform, and as a result, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing drivers on our platform. If we or drivers on our\\nplatform fail to comply with applicable laws, rules and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to safety incidents or data security breaches or\\nincidences, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChanges to our pricing could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.\\nDemand for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we charge drivers.\\nMany factors, including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies including\\nincreased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range\\nof offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. This\\nincludes the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we have\\nmade pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, through\\ncompetition, regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge the\\ndrivers on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. Furthermore,\\nthe economic sensitivity of drivers and riders on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to compete\\neffectively in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local laws\\nand  regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulations\\nregarding minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and Seattle. We have\\ntested or launched, and expect to in the future test or launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription packages and driver or rider loyalty programs. We\\nhave also modified, and expect to in the future modify, existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy. Any of the foregoing actions may not ultimately\\nbe successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in negative public perception and harm to our reputation.\\nWhile we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may ultimately be\\nunsuccessful. A determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharing\\nplatform as an employee, may require us to revise our pricing methodologies to account for such a change to driver classification.  The passage of Proposition 22 in\\nCalifornia has enabled us to provide additional earning opportunities to drivers in California, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has, and will continue to, require\\nadditional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, and\\nmay in the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining\\nqualified drivers. Moreover, successful litigation to overturn Proposition 22, or the reclassification of drivers on our platform as employees could reduce the available\\nsupply of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices and\\nbalance supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we could\\nbe underpricing or overpricing our offerings. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. As we continue to\\nlaunch new and develop existing asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, Driver Hubs, Driver Centers and Mobile Services, Lyft Auto Care,\\nExpress Drive program and Lyft Rentals, factors such as maintenance, debt service, depreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect our\\npricing methodologies. In addition, we have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may also\\naffect our pricing. Any such\\n26\\nchanges to our pricing methodologies or our ability to efficiently price our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we are unable to efficiently grow and further develop our network of Light Vehicles, which may not grow as we expect or become profitable over time, and manage\\nthe related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWhile some major cities have widely adopted bike and scooter sharing, there can be no assurance that new markets we enter will accept, or existing markets will\\ncontinue to accept, bike and scooter sharing, and even if they do, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our related offerings will be successful in\\nsuch markets. For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi Bike’s exclusivity,\\narguing that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco’s stations were in private garages. The City successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Joco,\\nwith our support. However, Joco continues to operate in a limited manner and it is possible Lyft may need to further support the City in additional legal action against Joco.\\nA negative determination in other legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, could\\nadversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted from\\noperating due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. For example, the City of Miami suspended\\nrentals of bikes and scooters from March through October 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and again suspended rentals of scooters from December 2020\\nthrough February 2021 and for a brief period in November 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. While we do not expect any denial or suspension in an\\nindividual region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we are able\\nto successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there could\\nbe negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving an\\nincreased number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidents\\non our platform or incidents involving our competitors’ offerings.\\nWe design and contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of bikes\\nand scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be no assurance we will be\\nable to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable basis, at a reasonable price or at all. We\\nalso  design  and  contract  to  manufacture  certain  assets  related  to  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles  and  we  rely  on  a  small  number  of  suppliers  for  components  and\\nmanufacturing services.\\nThe supply chain for our bikes and scooters exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or shortages. In the event that our supply of bikes and\\nscooters or key components is interrupted or there are significant increases in prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nChanges in business conditions, force majeure, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental or regulatory changes and other factors beyond our\\ncontrol have affected and could continue to affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver products and our ability to deploy products to the market on a timely basis.\\nWe incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing and operations of our network of Light Vehicles and we expect to continue incurring such costs\\nas we expand our network of Light Vehicles. The prices and availability of bikes and scooters and related products may fluctuate depending on factors beyond our control\\nincluding market and economic conditions, tariffs, changes to import or export regulations and demand. Substantial increases in prices of these assets or the cost of our\\noperations would increase our costs and reduce our margins, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, customs\\nauthorities may challenge or disagree with our classification, valuation or country of origin determinations of our imports. Such challenges could result in tariff liabilities,\\nincluding tariffs on past imports, as well as penalties and interest. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible tariff liabilities in our financial statements,\\nif these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.\\nOur  bikes  and  scooters  or  components  thereof,  including  bikes  and  scooters  and  components  that  we  design  and  contract  to  manufacture  using  third-party\\nsuppliers, have experienced and may in the future experience quality problems, product issues or acts of vandalism or theft from time to time, which could result in\\ndecreased usage of our network of Light Vehicles or loss of our bikes or scooters. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all product issues, vandalism\\nor theft of our Light Vehicles. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, litigation or regulatory challenges, including personal injury or products liability claims, and\\nharm to our reputation.\\nThe revenue we generate from our network of Light Vehicles may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to, among other things, seasonal factors including weather.\\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult for us to assess the exact nature or extent of the effects of seasonality on our network of Light Vehicles, however, we\\ngenerally experience a decline in demand for our bike and scooter rentals over the winter season and an increase during more temperate and dry seasons. Additionally, from\\ntime to time we may re-evaluate the markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and\\n27\\nmay in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we are unable to efficiently develop, enable, or implement partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platforms in a timely\\nmanner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe partner with several companies to develop autonomous vehicle technology and offerings. Autonomous driving is a new and evolving market, which makes it\\ndifficult  to  predict  its  acceptance,  its  growth,  and  the  magnitude  and  timing  of  necessary  investments  and  other  trends,  including  when  it  may  be  more  broadly  or\\ncommercially  available.  Our initiatives  may not  perform  as  expected,  which would reduce  the  return on our investments  in  this area  and our  partners  may  decide to\\nterminate  or scale  back  their partnerships  with us. In  addition, the  COVID-19 pandemic  did, and may  in the future,  adversely  delay or prevent  us, or  our current  or\\nprospective partners and suppliers, from being able to develop or deploy autonomous vehicle technology. Following the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, we\\nno longer develop our own autonomous vehicle technology, so we must develop and maintain partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technology\\non our platforms, and if we are unable to do so, or if we do so at a slower pace or at a higher cost or if our technology is less capable relative to our competitors, or if our\\nefforts  to  optimize  our  strategy  with  regard  to  our  autonomous  vehicle  technology  development  are  not  successful,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nThe autonomous vehicle industry may not continue to develop, or autonomous vehicles may not be adopted by the market, which could adversely affect our prospects,\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology for use on our platform. Autonomous driving\\ninvolves a complex set of technologies, including the continued development of sensing, computing and control technology. We have relied both on our own research and\\ndevelopment and on strategic partnerships with third-party developers of such technologies, as such technologies are costly and in varying stages of maturity. There is no\\nassurance that this research and development or these partnerships will result in the development of market-viable technologies or commercial success in a timely manner\\nor at all and as a result of the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, we are more reliant on partnerships for this development. In order to gain acceptance, the\\nreliability of autonomous vehicle technology must continue to advance.\\nAdditional challenges to the development and deployment of autonomous vehicle technology, all of which are outside of our control, include:\\n•\\nmarket acceptance of autonomous vehicles;\\n•\\nstate, federal or municipal licensing requirements, safety standards, and other regulatory measures;\\n•\\nnecessary changes to infrastructure to enable adoption;\\n•\\nconcerns regarding electronic security and privacy; and\\n•\\npublic perception regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles for drivers, riders, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road.\\nThere are a number of existing laws, regulations and standards that may apply to autonomous vehicle technology, including vehicle standards that were not\\noriginally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly evolve, which may increase the likelihood of complex,\\nconflicting or otherwise inconsistent regulations, which may delay our ability to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market or significantly increase the compliance\\ncosts associated with this business strategy. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market will accept autonomous vehicles or the timing of such acceptance, if at\\nall, and even if it does, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our offerings will be successful in the market. Even if autonomous vehicle technology\\nis successfully developed and implemented, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent technology and its adopters. In particular, there could be negative\\npublic  perception  surrounding  autonomous  vehicles,  including  the  overall  safety  and  the  potential  for  injuries  or  death  occurring  as  a  result  of  accidents  involving\\nautonomous  vehicles  and  the  potential  loss  of  income  to  human  drivers  resulting  from  widespread  market  adoption  of  autonomous  vehicles.  Such  negative  public\\nperception may result from incidents on our platform, incidents on our partners’ or competitors’ platforms, or events around autonomous vehicles more generally. Any of\\nthe foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nClaims from riders, drivers or third parties that are harmed, whether or not our platform is in use, could adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to injuries to, or deaths of, riders, drivers or third-parties that are\\nattributed to us through our offerings. We may also be subject to claims alleging that we are directly or vicariously liable for the acts of the drivers on our platform or for\\nharm related to the actions of drivers, riders, or third parties, or the management and safety of our platform and our assets, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic\\nand related public health measures issued by various jurisdictions, including travel bans, restrictions, social distancing guidance, and shelter-in-place\\n28\\norders. We may also be subject to personal injury claims whether or not such injury actually occurred as a result of activity on our platform. For example, third parties have\\nin the past asserted legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to the actions of a driver or rider who may have previously utilized our platform, but\\nwas not at the time of such injury. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency,\\nprotection of our reputation and to prevent the uncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we face\\nincreasing public scrutiny. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any riders, drivers or third parties could result in negative\\npublicity  and  harm  to  our  brand,  reputation,  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  Our  insurance  policies  and  programs  may  not  provide  sufficient\\ncoverage to adequately mitigate the potential liability we face, especially where any one incident, or a group of incidents, could cause disproportionate harm, and we may\\nhave to pay high premiums or deductibles for our coverage and, for certain situations, we may not be able to secure coverage at all.\\nAs we expand our network of Light Vehicles, we are subject to an increasing number of claims, lawsuits, investigations or other legal proceedings related to\\ninjuries to, or deaths of, riders of our Light Vehicles, including potential indemnification claims. In some cases, we could be required to indemnify governmental entities for\\nclaims arising out of issues, including issues that may be outside of our control, such as the condition of the public right of way. Any such claims arising from the use of our\\nLight Vehicles, regardless of merit or outcome, could lead to negative publicity, harm to our reputation and brand, significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure or\\ndecreased use of our Light Vehicles. Further, the bikes and scooters we design and contract to manufacture using third-party suppliers and manufacturers, including certain\\nassets and components we design and have manufactured for us, have in the past contained and could in the future contain design or manufacturing product issues, which\\ncould also lead to injuries or death to riders. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all product issues, and failure to do so could harm our\\nreputation and brand or result in personal injury or products liability claims or regulatory proceedings. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nOur bikes and scooters have experienced product issues from time to time, which has in the past resulted in, and, in the future may result in, product recalls and\\nremoval from service, injuries, litigation, enforcement actions and regulatory proceedings, and could adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe design, contract to design and manufacture, and directly and indirectly modify, maintain and repair, bikes and scooters for our network of Light Vehicles.\\nSuch bikes and scooters have in the past contained, and, in the future may contain, product issues related to their design, materials or construction, may be improperly\\nmaintained or repaired or may be subject to vandalism. These product issues, improper maintenance or repair or vandalism have in the past unexpectedly interfered, and\\ncould in the future unexpectedly interfere, with the intended operations of the bikes or scooters, and have resulted, and could in the future result, in other safety concerns,\\nincluding alleged injuries to riders or third parties. Although we, our contract manufacturers, and our third-party service providers test our bikes and scooters before they\\nare deployed onto our network, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect or prevent all product issues.\\nFailure to detect, prevent, fix or timely report real or perceived product issues and vandalism, or to properly maintain or repair our bikes and scooters has resulted\\nor  may  result  in  a  variety  of consequences  including  product  recalls  and  removal  from  service,  service  interruptions,  alleged  injuries,  litigation,  enforcement  actions,\\nincluding fines or penalties, regulatory proceedings, and negative publicity. Even if injuries to riders or third parties are not the result of any product issues in, vandalism of,\\nor the failure to properly maintain or repair our bikes or scooters, we may incur expenses to defend or settle any claims or respond to regulatory inquiries, and our brand and\\nreputation may be harmed. Any of the foregoing risks could also result in decreased usage of our network of Light Vehicles and adversely affect our business, brand,\\nfinancial conditions and results of operations.\\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nSince 2012 and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we generally experienced rapid growth in our business, the number of users on our platform and our geographic\\nreach, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future following the recovery of the world economy from the pandemic. This growth placed, and may continue\\nto place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Employee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquarters\\nand in a number of our offices across the United States and internationally. The number of our full-time employees increased from 2,708 as of December 31, 2017, to 4,453\\nas of December 31, 2021. However, from time to time, we have undertaken restructuring actions to better align our financial model and our business. For example, in the\\nsecond quarter of 2020, we implemented a plan of termination to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges resulting\\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, which plan involved the termination of approximately 17% of our employees. Steps we take to manage our\\nbusiness operations, including remote work policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies for future growth may adversely affect our reputation and\\nbrand, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel.\\nOur ability to manage our growth and business operations effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business will\\nrequire us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees. Continued growth\\ncould strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retain\\nhighly skilled personnel and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the\\n29\\nquality of our offerings could suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAny actual or perceived security or privacy breach or incident could interrupt our operations, harm our brand and adversely affect our reputation, brand, business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of our users’ personal data and other sensitive data. Additionally, we maintain other\\nconfidential, proprietary, or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business, including intellectual property, and similar information we receive from third parties.\\nAn increasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions and government\\ninstitutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly\\ntargeted attacks. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and may not be known until launched\\nagainst us, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or\\nfacilities we maintain or use in our business through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of our service providers,\\npartners or users on our platform, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, service providers, partners, users or others into disclosing rider names, passwords,\\npayment card information or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems, or attempting to fraudulently induce our\\nemployees, partners or others into manipulating payment information, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to criminal actors. In addition, users on our platform\\ncould have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platform, but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us.\\nFurther,  breaches  or  incidents  experienced  by  other  companies  may  also  be  leveraged  against  us.  For  example,  credential  stuffing  attacks  are  becoming  increasingly\\ncommon and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored or supported by\\nsignificant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect.\\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our users’ data, prevent data loss and prevent other security breaches or incidents,\\nthese security measures cannot guarantee total security or prevent incidents from impacting our platform. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable\\nto cyberattacks or security breaches or incidents, including ransomware or other malware that may result in interruptions to our operations or unavailability of our platform,\\nand third parties may be able to access our users’ personal information and payment card data that are accessible through those systems. Additionally, as we expand our\\noperations, including licensing or sharing data with third parties, having employees or third-party relationships in jurisdictions outside the United States, or expand work-\\nfrom-home practices of our employees (including increased use of video conferencing), our exposure to cyberattacks or security breaches and incidents may increase.\\nFurther, employee and service provider error, malfeasance or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in an actual or perceived\\nprivacy or security breach or other security incident. Although we have policies restricting access to personal information we store, in the past there have been allegations\\nregarding violations of these policies and we may be subject to these types of allegations in the future. Our third-party service providers also face similar security risks. We\\nand our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyberattacks or other sources of\\nsecurity breaches or incidents, and we or they may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to cyberattacks and data security breaches and incidents. In\\nparticular, our service providers may also be the targets of cyberattacks, malicious software, phishing schemes, and other attacks, and our third-party service providers’\\nsystems and networks may be, or may have been, breached or contain exploitable vulnerabilities or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our or their systems\\nor networks.\\nAny actual or perceived privacy or security breach or incident could interrupt our operations, result in our platform being unavailable or otherwise disrupted, result\\nin loss, alteration, unavailability or improper use or disclosure of data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships with\\nthird-party partners, result in regulatory investigations and other proceedings, private claims, demands, litigation and other proceedings, loss of our ability to accept credit\\nor debit card payments, increased card processing fees, and other significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of driver or rider confidence in, or\\ndecreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any actual or perceived privacy or security\\nbreach or incident impacting any entities with which we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party technology providers, third party autonomous vehicle\\nproviders, or other parties with whom we have agreed to share our data under licensing or other commercial arrangements) could have similar effects. In addition, any\\nactual or perceived privacy or security breach or incident impacting any autonomous vehicles, whether through our platform or our competitors’, could result in legal,\\nregulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of rider confidence in our platform, which could significantly undermine our business strategy. Further, any cyberattacks\\ndirected toward, or privacy or security breaches or incidents impacting, our competitors could reduce confidence in the ridesharing industry as a whole and, as a result,\\nreduce confidence in us.\\nWe incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents and we expect our costs will increase as we\\ncontinue to implement systems and processes designed to prevent and otherwise address security breaches and incidents. In the event of a future breach or incident, we\\ncould be required to expend additional significant capital and other resources in an effort to respond to prevent further breaches or incidents, which may require us to divert\\nsubstantial resources.\\n30\\nMoreover, we could be required or otherwise find it appropriate to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to, notify third parties of, and otherwise address\\nthe breach or incident and its root cause.\\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any actual or perceived privacy or security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, could be\\ncostly and divert management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred,\\nthat insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The\\nsuccessful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including\\npremium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition\\nand results of operations.\\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our offerings to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web\\nServices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations using Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do\\nnot have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity\\nattacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We\\nhave experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors,\\nincluding infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may\\nadversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated\\nsystem failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak\\nusage times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and may\\nadversely affect the usage of our offerings.\\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after January\\n31, 2026, and only after complying with certain advance notice requirements. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for\\nfailure to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated\\nor we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new\\ncloud infrastructure service providers. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead\\nto a significant short term loss of revenue, increase our costs and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nOn February 1, 2022 we entered into an addendum to our commercial agreement with AWS, pursuant to which we committed to spend an aggregate of at least\\n$350 million between February 2022 and January 2026 on AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the four years. If we fail to meet the minimum\\npurchase commitment during any year, we may be required to pay the difference, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe  rely  on  third-party  and  affiliate  vehicle  rental  partners  for  our  Express  Drive  program  and  Lyft  Rentals  program,  as  well  as  third-party  vehicle  supply,  fleet\\nmanagement and finance partners to support our Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals program, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such parties and\\nother risks related to our Express Drive and Lyft Rentals program, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners to supply vehicles to\\ndrivers for our Express Drive program. If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners terminates its\\nrelationship  with  us  or  refuses  to  renew  its  agreement  with  us  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  the  availability  of  vehicles  for  drivers  in  certain  markets  could  be\\nadversely impacted, and we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame.\\nSimilarly, in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a result of\\npublic  health  crises,  such as  the  COVID-19 pandemic,  affecting  vehicles  in  these  partners’  fleets,  the  supply  of  vehicles  available  from  these  partners  could  become\\nconstrained. For example, in September 2019, GM issued a recall affecting the 2018 Chevy Malibu, which affected a moderate portion of the fleet provided by Lyft’s rental\\npartners. In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected their ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program. If we cannot\\nfind alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners’ fleets are impacted by events such as vehicle recalls, we may not be able to\\nmeet the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers and consumers. In addition, due to a\\nnumber of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-related insurance program, we incur an incrementally higher insurance cost from\\nour  Express  Drive  program  compared  to  the  corresponding  cost  from  the  rest  of  our  ridesharing  marketplace  offerings.  If  Flexdrive,  Lyft’s  independently  managed\\nsubsidiary, is unable to manage costs of operating Flexdrive’s fleet and potential shortfalls between such costs and the rental fees collected from drivers, Lyft and Flexdrive\\nmay update the pricing methodologies related to Flexdrive’s offering in\\n31\\nLyft’s Express Drive program which could increase prices, and in turn adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers.\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners, including publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns,\\ncould adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur Express Drive program, Lyft Rentals program, and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including with respect to decreases in the residual\\nvalue related to the used car market values, or reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.\\nFor the  Lyft  Rentals  consumer  car  rental  business  and,  through  our  independently  managed  subsidiary,  Flexdrive,  for  vehicles  rented  to  drivers  through  our\\nExpress  Drive  program,  a  portion  of  the  fleet  is  sourced  from  a  range  of  auto  manufacturers.  In  addition,  we  have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as  our\\ncommitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or vehicles that we source from or purchase. To the extent\\nthat any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of purchasing cars or decline to sell cars to us on terms or at prices consistent with\\npast agreements, despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market and other efforts to mitigate, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles to operate our\\nExpress Drive or Lyft Rentals businesses without significantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public health\\ncrises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or our ability to rent\\nvehicles in Lyft Rentals or the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.\\nReduced utilization has increased and could continue to increase costs of maintaining the fleets or storing or moving unused vehicles.\\nThe costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. We currently sell vehicles through auctions, third-\\nparty resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices. It may be difficult to estimate the residual\\nvalue of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through our Express Drive program. Further, market events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have\\naffected the demand for or pricing in the used vehicle market. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operators of large fleets, such as rental companies, are\\nreportedly seeking to place large volumes of vehicles into the resale market, which have driven down the price and corresponding residual value of used vehicles. A\\nreduction in residual values for vehicles in the Flexdrive or Lyft Rentals fleets could cause us to sustain a substantial loss on the ultimate sale of such vehicles or require us\\nto depreciate those vehicles at a more accelerated rate. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the fleet of vehicles cost-efficiently or if we are unable to accurately forecast\\nthe residual values of vehicles in the fleets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe  rely  on  third-party  payment  processors  to  process  payments  made  by  riders  and  payments  made  to  drivers  on  our  platform,  and  if  we  cannot  manage  our\\nrelationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform. If any of our\\nthird-party payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an\\nalternate payment processor, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software and services\\nprovided by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks\\ncould cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to drivers on our platform, any of which could make\\nour platform less convenient and attractive to users and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders.\\nNearly all rider payments and driver payouts are made by credit card, debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain payment\\nnetwork or service provider operating rules, to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to riders that may be subject to\\nadditional operating rules, regulations and risks. We may also be subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we accept from riders, including\\nwith respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy, data protection and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may be\\nsubject to civil or criminal penalties, fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could\\nmake our offerings less convenient  and attractive  to riders.  If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial  condition and results of operations  could be\\nadversely affected.\\nFor example, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable regulation, we could be subject to certain laws, rules and regulations enforced\\nby multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and numerous state and local agencies who may define money transmitter differently. For example,\\ncertain states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we could be subject to additional laws,\\nrules and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations and regulators governing\\nour business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we are not in compliance with such\\nregulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more\\n32\\njurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators, including state Attorneys General, as well as those levied by foreign regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for\\nfailing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions. We could\\nalso be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\\nFor various payment options, we are required to pay fees such as interchange and processing fees that are imposed by payment processors, payment networks and\\nfinancial  institutions.  These  fees  are  subject  to  increases,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.  Additionally,  our\\npayment processors require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks and which include, among\\nother obligations, requirements to comply with security standards. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in\\nways that might prohibit us from providing certain offerings to some users, be costly to implement or difficult to follow, and if we fail or are alleged to fail to comply with\\napplicable rules or requirements of payment card networks, we may be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or\\nother payment card transactions. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors for fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we or the users on our\\nplatform violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe rely on other third-party service providers and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase and\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur success depends in part on our relationships  with other third-party  service  providers.  For example,  we rely on third-party  encryption  and authentication\\ntechnologies licensed from third parties that are designed to securely transmit personal information provided by drivers and riders on our platform. Further, from time to\\ntime, we enter into strategic commercial partnerships in connection with the development of new technology, the growth of our qualified driver base, the provision of new\\nor enhanced offerings for users on our platform and our expansion into new markets. If any of our partners terminates its relationship with us, or refuses to renew its\\nagreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such providers in\\nan acceptable time frame. We also rely on other software and services supplied by third parties, such as communications and internal software, and our business may be\\nadversely affected to the extent such software and services do not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised or experience outages. Any of\\nthese risks could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any negative publicity related to any of our\\nthird-party partners, including any publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to\\nincreased regulatory or litigation exposure.\\nWe incorporate technology from third parties into our platform, products, and services. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual\\nproperty rights of others or that the suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the technology in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Some of our license\\nagreements may be terminated by our licensors for convenience. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual property\\ninfringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into new\\nagreements on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop our platform or products containing that technology or provide services using that technology could be\\nseverely limited and our business could be harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop\\nalternate technology, which may require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards. This would limit and delay our ability to provide\\nnew or competitive offerings and increase our costs. If alternate technology cannot be obtained or developed, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of our\\nofferings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we are not able to successfully develop new offerings on our platform and enhance our existing offerings, our business, financial condition and results of operations\\ncould be adversely affected.\\nOur ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and increase utilization of our offerings will depend\\nin part on our ability to successfully create and introduce new offerings and to improve upon and enhance our existing offerings. As a result, we may introduce significant\\nchanges to our existing offerings or develop and introduce new and unproven offerings. For example, in April 2020, we began piloting a delivery service platform in\\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. If these new or enhanced offerings are unsuccessful, including as a result of any inability to obtain and maintain required permits or\\nauthorizations or other regulatory constraints or because they fail to generate sufficient return on our investments, our business, financial condition and results of operations\\ncould  be  adversely  affected.  Furthermore,  new  driver  or  rider  demands  regarding  service  or  platform  features,  the  availability  of  superior  competitive  offerings  or  a\\ndeterioration in the quality of our offerings or our ability to bring new or enhanced offerings to market quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the attractiveness of\\nour platform  and the economics  of our business and require us to make substantial  changes to and additional  investments  in our offerings  or our business model. In\\naddition,  we  frequently  experiment  with  and  test  different  offerings  and  marketing  strategies.  If  these  experiments  and  tests  are  unsuccessful,  or  if  the  offerings  and\\nstrategies we introduce based on the results of such experiments and tests do not perform as expected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain\\nexisting qualified drivers and existing riders and maintain or increase utilization of our offerings may be adversely affected.\\n33\\nDeveloping and launching new offerings or enhancements to the existing offerings on our platform involves significant risks and uncertainties, including risks\\nrelated to the reception of such offerings by existing and potential future drivers and riders, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated delays or challenges in\\nimplementing such offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of our ability to accurately forecast rider\\ndemand and the number of drivers using our platform), our dependence on strategic commercial partnerships, and negative publicity in the event such new or enhanced\\nofferings are perceived to be unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new initiatives have in the past resulted in, and in the future may result in,\\noperational challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new offerings and enhancements to our existing offerings may involve significant up-\\nfront capital investments and such investments may not generate return on investment. Further, from time to time we may reevaluate, discontinue and/or reduce these\\ninvestments and decide to discontinue one or more offerings. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified\\ndrivers and riders, our ability to increase utilization of our offerings and our visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations. Additionally, since we are focused on building our community and ecosystems for the long-term, our near-term results of operations\\nmay be impacted by our investments in the future.\\nIf  we  are  unable  to  successfully  manage  the  complexities  associated  with  our  expanding  multimodal  platform,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nOur expansion into bike and scooter sharing, other modes of transportation, auto repair and collision services, vehicle rental programs and delivery services has\\nincreased the complexity of our business. These new offerings have required us to develop new expertise and marketing and operational strategies, and have subjected us to\\nnew laws, regulations and risks. For example, we face the risk that our network of Light Vehicles, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party public transit\\ndata into the Lyft App, and other future transportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering. Additionally, from time to time we may reevaluate our\\nofferings on our multimodal platform and decide to discontinue an offering or certain features. Such actions may negatively impact revenue in the short term and may not\\nprovide the benefits we expect in the long term. If we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our expanding multimodal platform, including the\\neffects our new and evolving offerings have on our existing business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur new delivery service platform may not be successful and may expose us to additional risks.\\nWe are in the process of developing and assessing the feasibility of a business-to-business delivery service platform. This offering, which began in April 2020,\\ncurrently allows businesses to send goods from one location to another. Drivers are provided the opportunity to opt-in to receive delivery requests and are currently paid\\nbased on a delivery-specific pay structure. Delivery is not currently available in all markets and therefore not all drivers have the opportunity to receive delivery requests at\\nthis time. We face a number of challenges that may affect the ultimate success of this offering, including:\\n•\\nthe market for this offering may not be sustained following the COVID-19 pandemic, or may not develop at all;\\n•\\nwe may be unable to attract and retain drivers for this offering, drivers currently using our platform may not opt-in to drive for this offering, or this offering may\\ndivert drivers from our rideshare platform, which may create shortages of driver supply;\\n•\\nwe may be unable to attract and retain businesses to participate in this offering;\\n•\\nwe may fail to develop an effective pricing model for this offering that incentivizes drivers and businesses to use this offering while maintaining margins for us;\\n•\\nour competitors may have more experience with respect to business or consumer deliveries, greater brand recognition in the delivery space, or greater financial or\\nother resources that enable them to derive greater revenue, attract and retain drivers and businesses for their similar offerings, and more efficiently provide their\\nofferings;\\n•\\nwe may incur additional costs and expenses associated with providing business or consumer delivery services, including insurance-related and other costs;\\n•\\nwe may be subject to litigation in a number of areas, including personal injury and automotive liability, and we may be unsuccessful in compelling to arbitration\\nclaims brought by drivers providing rideshare and delivery services on the Lyft Platform;\\n•\\nwe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that are costly to comply with and may affect the profitability of this offering or our ability to offer delivery in\\nsome markets, including laws and regulations regarding pricing or driver benefits, and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations will adversely affect\\nour deliveries offering;\\n34\\n•\\nthe implementation of Proposition 22 in California may have an impact on delivery rate cards, which could impact our competitiveness and ability to operate\\nwithin California; and\\n•\\nwe may fail to effectively respond to market developments in a timely manner, or at all.\\nAdditionally, the development of this delivery service platform may divert resources, including management’s attention, from our other offerings and adversely\\naffect their development. If we are unable to develop and grow our delivery service platform, or unable to do so cost-effectively, whether as a result of our own actions or\\nmarket conditions more generally, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur metrics and estimates, including the key metrics included in this report, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in\\nthose metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nWe regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics used to evaluate our growth, measure our performance and make strategic decisions.\\nThese metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been evaluated by a third-party. Our metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or\\nfrom similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or the assumptions on which we rely, and we may make material adjustments to our\\nprocesses for calculating our metrics in order to enhance accuracy, because better information becomes available or other reasons, which may result in changes to our\\nmetrics. The estimates and forecasts we disclose relating to the size and expected growth of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in\\nwhich we compete meet the size estimates and growth we have forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. If investors or analysts do not consider\\nour metrics to be accurate representations of our business, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, then the trading price of our Class A common stock and\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\\nPromoting awareness of our offerings is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new qualified drivers and new riders and can be costly. We\\nbelieve that much of the growth in our rider base and the number of drivers on our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts include\\nreferrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising, television, billboards, radio, video, content, direct mail, social media, email, hiring and\\nclassified  advertisement  websites,  mobile  “push”  communications,  search  engine  optimization  and  keyword  search  campaigns.  Our marketing  initiatives  may  become\\nincreasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing\\nefforts, it may not offset the additional marketing expenses we incur.\\nIf our marketing efforts are not successful in promoting awareness of our offerings or attracting new qualified drivers and new riders, or if we are not able to cost-\\neffectively manage our marketing expenses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. If our marketing efforts are successful in increasing awareness of our\\nofferings, this could also lead to increased public scrutiny of our business and increase the likelihood of third parties bringing legal proceedings against us. Any of the\\nforegoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAny failure to offer high-quality user support may harm our relationships with users and could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition\\nand results of operations.\\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders is dependent in part on the ease and reliability of our offerings, including our ability to provide high-\\nquality support. Users on our platform depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our offerings, such as being overcharged for a ride, leaving\\nsomething in a driver’s vehicle or reporting a safety incident. Our ability to provide effective and timely support is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain\\nservice  providers  who  are  qualified  to  support  users  and  sufficiently  knowledgeable  regarding  our  offerings.  As  we  continue  to  grow  our  business  and  improve  our\\nofferings, we will face challenges related to providing quality support services at scale. If we grow our international rider base and the number of international drivers on\\nour platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support in languages other than English. Furthermore, the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to provide effective and timely support, including as a result of a decrease in the availability of service providers and increase\\nin response time. Any failure to provide efficient user support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation,\\nbrand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business.\\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, claims of\\nunauthorized payments by a rider, attempted payments by riders with insufficient funds and fraud committed by riders in concert with drivers. Bad actors use increasingly\\nsophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person’s identity, account information or payment\\ninformation and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information and mobile phone numbers and accounts. Under current card\\npayment practices, we may be liable for rides facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card\\ntransaction. Despite measures that we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that any\\nof our measures will be effective or\\n35\\nwill scale efficiently with our business. Our inability to adequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or\\nregulatory action and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe have also incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from fraud and other misuse of our platform by drivers and riders, including in connection with\\nprograms we put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides fulfilled\\nand miles traveled in connection with our Concierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased controls, platform\\nsolutions or other means, our partner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to effectively match riders on our Shared and Shared Saver Rides offering and manage the related pricing methodologies, our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nShared and Shared Saver Rides enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to benefit from a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer travel times.\\nWith a Shared or Shared Saver Ride, when the first rider requests a ride, our algorithms use the first rider’s destination and attempt to match them with other riders\\ntraveling along a similar route. If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.\\nFor Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to riders\\nand the level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able to\\nmatch additional riders along the given route, and such fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from the\\npayment made to the driver as we do not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to our\\nShared or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Rides\\nriders, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to effectively manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWith the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform and\\nservice fees from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driver\\nbased on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives and\\nany pass-through amounts paid to drivers and third parties. As we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,\\nwe take on risks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider is\\nless  than the  amount  we committed  to pay  a driver. In  addition,  riders’  price  sensitivity  varies  by geographic  location,  among  other factors,  and if  we are unable  to\\neffectively  account  for  such  variability  in  our  up-front  prices,  our  ability  to  compete  effectively  in  these  locations  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  we  are  unable  to\\neffectively manage our up-front pricing methodology in conjunction with our existing and future pricing and incentive programs, our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.\\nWe  believe  that  our  company  culture,  which  promotes  authenticity,  empathy  and  support  for  others,  has  been  critical  to  our  success.  We  face  a  number  of\\nchallenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\\n•\\nfailure to identify, attract, reward and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values and mission;\\n•\\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\\n•\\nshelter-in-place orders in certain jurisdictions where we operate that have required many of our employees to work remotely, as well as permanent return to work\\narrangements and workplace strategies;\\n•\\nthe inability to achieve adherence to our internal policies and core values, including our diversity, equity and inclusion practices and initiatives;\\n•\\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values;\\n•\\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry;\\n•\\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\\n36\\n•\\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees or our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\\n•\\nthe provision of employee benefits in the COVID-19 environment; and\\n•\\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\\nFrom time to time, we have undertaken workforce reductions in order to better align our operations with our strategic priorities, managing our cost structure or in\\nconnection with acquisitions. For example, in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we took certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs,\\nfurloughs and salary reductions, which may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees. These actions may adversely\\naffect  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  personnel  and maintain  our  culture.  If  we are  not  able  to  maintain  our  culture,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain, motivate or integrate our personnel, our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur success depends in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel and on\\nour ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. We may not be successful in attracting and\\nretaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs and actions we take in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business may harm our\\nreputation or impact our ability to recruit qualified personnel in the future. For example, in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we have\\nundertaken certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs, furloughs and salary reductions, which may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to\\nattract and retain employees. Also, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our management team, work for us on an at-will basis, and there is no assurance that any\\nsuch employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be\\ndifficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly in\\ncritical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.\\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled personnel, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly\\nskilled personnel. This competition has intensified in recent periods, and may continue to intensify as the economy recovers from COVID-19. To attract and retain top\\ntalent, we have had to offer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel often\\nconsider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines or we are unable to provide\\ncompetitive compensation packages, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition. Certain\\nof our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our employees have received and may continue to receive\\nsignificant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant\\namounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train and integrate such employees, and we\\nmay never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet\\nforecasts and employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users and unfavorable changes in or our failure to comply with\\nexisting or future laws governing the Internet and mobile devices.\\nOur  business  depends  on  users’  access  to  our  platform  via  a  mobile  device  and  the  Internet.  We  may  operate  in  jurisdictions  that  provide  limited  Internet\\nconnectivity, particularly as we expand internationally. Internet access and access to a mobile device are frequently provided by companies with significant market power\\nthat could take actions that degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of users’ ability to access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our\\nplatform rely on in any particular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device accessibility, even for\\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nMoreover, we are subject to a number of laws and regulations specifically governing the Internet and mobile devices that are constantly evolving. Existing and\\nfuture laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth and availability of the Internet and online offerings, require us to change our business practices or\\nraise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover taxation, privacy and data protection, information\\nsecurity,  pricing,  copyrights,  distribution,  mobile  and  other  communications,  advertising  practices,  consumer  protections,  the  provision  of  online  payment  services,\\nunencumbered Internet access to our offerings and the characteristics and quality of online offerings, among other things. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply\\nwith any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or\\nothers, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\\n37\\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our apps available to the drivers and riders on our platform, and if we do not effectively\\noperate with or receive favorable placements within such application marketplaces and maintain high rider reviews, our usage or brand recognition could decline and\\nour business, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application marketplaces to make our apps available to the drivers\\nand riders on our platform. Any changes in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our apps or give preferential treatment to our\\ncompetitors’ apps could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile devices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from\\nmaking  our  apps  available  to  drivers  and  riders,  make  changes  that  degrade  the  functionality  of  our  apps,  increase  the  cost  of  using  our  apps,  impose  terms  of  use\\nunsatisfactory to us or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’\\napplication marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our apps, overall growth in our rider or driver base could slow. Our apps have experienced fluctuations in\\nnumber of downloads in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to support our platform or effectively roll\\nout updates to our apps. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need to ensure that our offerings are designed to work effectively with a range of mobile\\ntechnologies, systems, networks and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that\\nenhance drivers’ and riders’ experience. If drivers or riders on our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our apps on their mobile devices or if we are unable\\nto adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not control.\\nWe have integrations with a variety of productivity, collaboration, travel, data management and security vendors. As our offerings expand and evolve, including to\\nthe extent we continue to develop autonomous technology, we may have an increasing number of integrations with other third-party applications, products and services.\\nThird-party applications, products and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with third-\\nparty offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or technology partners may take actions which disrupt the interoperability of our\\nplatform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we operate and distribute our platform. As our\\nrespective  products  evolve,  we  expect  the  types  and  levels  of  competition  to  increase.  Should  any  of  our  competitors  or  technology  partners  modify  their  products,\\nstandards or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment to\\ncompetitive products or services, our products, platform, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nDefects, errors or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems or other technology systems and those of third-party technology providers, or system failures and\\nresulting interruptions in our availability or the availability of other systems and providers, could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the\\ncode has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment,” which refers to the frequent release of our software code,\\nsometimes multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying our platform. The third-party\\nsoftware that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerability. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from third-party\\nsoftware after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue and access or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be\\nexploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or incident. We may need to expend significant\\nfinancial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and\\neffectively resolve any such errors, defects or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as negatively impact\\nour reputation or brand.\\nFurther, our systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects\\nor malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in\\ntelecommunications  services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware or other events. Our systems also may be\\nsubject to break-ins, sabotage, theft and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster\\nrecovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from\\ninterruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or\\nreduce or affect the speed or functionality of our offerings. These events have resulted in, and similar\\n38\\nfuture events could result in, losses of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our offerings\\ncould adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in harm or\\nlosses to the users using our platform, we may make voluntary payments to compensate for such harm or the affected users could seek monetary recourse or contractual\\nremedies from us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.\\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict\\nour ability to provide our offerings.\\nOur platform and offerings contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and distribution of open source\\nsoftware may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or\\nother contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to\\ncompromise our platform and offerings.\\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open\\nsource software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could,\\nunder certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar\\nofferings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the public release of the\\naffected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\\nAlthough we have processes for using open source software to avoid subjecting our platform and offerings to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open\\nsource licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated\\nconditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform and offerings. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open\\nsource software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of\\nwhat we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform will be\\neffective. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other\\nliability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform,\\nto discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, in source code form, our\\nproprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur  presence  outside  the  United  States  and  any  future  international  expansion  strategy  will  subject  us  to  additional  costs  and  risks  and  our  plans  may  not  be\\nsuccessful.\\nIn 2017, we launched our offerings in Canada and we may continue to expand our international offerings. In addition, we have several international offices that\\nsupport our business. We also transact internationally to source and manufacture bikes and scooters and may increase our business in international regions in the future.\\nOperating outside of the United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and\\ncustoms, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering and operations teams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may\\nnot be successful in our international expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\\n•\\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;\\n•\\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively and may enjoy greater local affinity or\\nawareness;\\n•\\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our offerings less successful;\\n•\\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses;\\n•\\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, tax, trade compliance and local regulatory\\nrestrictions and disclosure requirements;\\n•\\nineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries or theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and other\\nconfidential business information;\\n•\\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses or other authorizations;\\n•\\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\\n39\\n•\\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\\n•\\npolitical, economic, or social instability, which has caused disruptions in certain of our office locations, including in Belarus and Ukraine;\\n•\\ntax policies, treaties or laws that could have an unfavorable business impact; and\\n•\\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be\\nsuccessful, which may result in shutting down international operations or closing international offices. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations\\ninternationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIn addition, international expansion has increased our risks in complying with laws and standards in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including with respect to\\ncustoms, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls and trade and economic sanctions. We cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in\\nviolation of applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. In particular, any violation of the applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls and\\nsimilar laws could result in adverse media coverage, investigations, significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions or suspension or\\ndebarment from U.S. government contracts, and/or substantial diversion of management’s attention, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand,\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, public\\ncompanies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations,\\nproduct liability, defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, securities, consumer protection,\\ntaxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile\\napplication accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcare\\nfraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions,\\nlobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods including (but\\nnot limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations,  in many cases due to their lack of\\nspecificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by\\nregulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\\nThe ridesharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a peer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012,\\nthe laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that were in existence at that time, and some that have since been\\nadopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharing\\nmarketplace. We have been proactively working with federal, state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our ridesharing marketplace and other\\nofferings are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part due to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address the\\nunique issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted in\\nresponse to our industry and related technologies. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts\\nmay claim that we or users on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or that\\nusers on our platform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, including\\nairports, require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting and other compliance requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter sharing,\\nauto repair and collision services, Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our applications for\\npermits, revoke existing or deny renewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose fines and penalties,\\nincluding  as a result  of errors  in, or failures  to comply  with,  reporting  or  other requirements  related  to our  product  offerings.  Any of the  foregoing  actions  by these\\njurisdictions and governmental entities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nRecent financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and companies\\nengaged in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that\\nare adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in the market or otherwise, they may view\\nmatters or interpret\\n40\\nlaws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. See the risk factor entitled “Challenges to contractor classification of\\ndrivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.” Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create\\ndifferent  or  conflicting  obligations  from  one  jurisdiction  to  another,  and  may  have  a  negative  outcome  that  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations,  financial\\ncondition, and results of operations. Additionally, we have invested and from time to time we will continue to invest resources in an attempt to influence or challenge\\nlegislation  and  other  regulatory  matters  pertinent  to  our  operations,  particularly  those  related  to  the  ridesharing  industry,  which  may  negatively  impact  the  legal  and\\nadministrative  proceedings  challenging  the  classification  of  drivers  on  our  platform  as  independent  contractors  if  we  are  unsuccessful  or  lead  to  additional  costs  and\\nexpenses even if we are successful. These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition\\nand results of operations.\\nOur industry is relatively nascent and is rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipal\\nregulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing.\\nFor example, in December 2018, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings calculations and utilization rates\\napplicable to our ridesharing platform, as well as certain other ridesharing platforms. Our legal challenge was unsuccessful and other cities are exploring similar legislation.\\nThe  City  of  Seattle  adopted  the  Transportation  Network  Company  Driver  Minimum  Compensation  Ordinance  effective  January  1,  2021,  which  sets  minimum  driver\\nearnings calculations for our rideshare platform as well as other rideshare platforms. The City of Portland is also exploring driver earnings legislation. Other jurisdictions in\\nwhich we currently operate or may want to operate could follow suit. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operations\\ninternationally, particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on or\\nmaterial limitations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model negatively to\\nraise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may continue to take actions\\nand employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to change\\nsuch legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.\\nAny of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChallenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings\\nat the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a driver is an\\nindependent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of\\nindependent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. For more\\ninformation regarding the litigation in which we have been involved, see the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to\\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, in 2021, the U.S. Secretary of Labor expressed his view\\nthat  in  some  cases  “gig  workers  should  be  classified  as  employees”  and  that  further  review  was  ongoing.  We  continue  to  maintain  that  drivers  on  our  platform  are\\nindependent contractors in such legal and administrative proceedings and intend to continue to defend ourself vigorously in these matters, but our arguments may ultimately\\nbe unsuccessful. A determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver of a ridesharing\\nplatform as an employee, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of:\\n•\\nmonetary  exposure  arising  from  or  relating  to  failure  to  withhold  and  remit  taxes,  unpaid  wages  and  wage  and  hour  laws  and  requirements  (such  as  those\\npertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide required breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive\\ndamages, penalties, including related to the California Private Attorneys General Act, and government fines;\\n•\\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\\n•\\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation and unemployment;\\n•\\nclaims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation under civil rights laws;\\n•\\nclaims under new or existing laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining and other concerted activity;\\n•\\nother claims, charges or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees, including risks relating to allegations of joint\\nemployer liability or agency liability; and\\n41\\n•\\nharm to our reputation and brand.\\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee\\nmay require us to significantly alter our existing business model and/or operations (including suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs\\nand impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\\nWe  have  been  involved  in  numerous  legal  proceedings  related  to  driver  classification.  We  are  currently  involved  in  several  putative  class  actions,  several\\nrepresentative  actions  brought,  for  example,  pursuant  to  California’s  Private  Attorney  General  Act,  several  multi-plaintiff  actions  and  thousands  of  individual  claims,\\nincluding those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent\\ncontractors. We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey. See the\\nsection titled “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\\nClaims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\\nCompanies in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property\\nrights. In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwise\\nobtained. As we gain an increasingly high public profile and the number of competitors in our market increases and as we continue to develop new technologies and\\nintellectual property, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public profile, increases in the number of\\ncompetitors in our markets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new IP, as well as potential international expansion. From time\\nto time third parties may assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” for\\nadditional information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual property\\ninfringement and, in some instances, have initiated licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will be\\nsuccessful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future have\\nsignificantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies or\\nother adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.\\nMany potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to assert their intellectual\\nproperty rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract\\nour management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in\\nconnection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantial\\ndamages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us from\\nusing or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adversely\\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which may\\nnot be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore\\nour competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all,\\nwe may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require significant time (during which we would be unable\\nto continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other forms of\\ninformation, knowhow and technology), or intellectual property, and as we grow, we will continue to develop intellectual property that is important for our existing or\\nfuture business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and\\nprotect our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and may vary by jurisdiction. Even if we\\ndo detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and\\nexpensive and could divert management attention. While we take precautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and other\\nunauthorized third parties to copy our technology, reverse engineer our data and use our proprietary information to create or enhance competing solutions and services,\\nwhich could adversely affect our position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Some license provisions that protect against unauthorized use, copying,\\ntransfer and disclosure of our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and\\n42\\nforeign countries. The laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property as do the laws of the United States and effective\\nintellectual  property  protections  may  not  be  available  or  may  be  limited  in  foreign  countries.  Our  domestic  and  international  intellectual  property  protection  and\\nenforcement strategy is influenced by many considerations including costs, where we have business operations, where we might have business operations in the future,\\nlegal protections available in a specific jurisdiction, and/or other strategic considerations. As such, we do not have identical or analogous intellectual property protection in\\nall jurisdictions, which could risk freedom to operate in certain jurisdictions if we were to expand. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized\\nuse,  copying,  transfer  and  disclosure  of  proprietary  information  will  likely  increase.  We  may  need  to  expend  additional  resources  to  protect,  enforce  or  defend  our\\nintellectual property rights domestically or internationally, which could impair our business or adversely affect our domestic or international operations. We enter into\\nconfidentiality  and invention assignment  agreements  with our employees  and consultants and enter  into confidentiality  agreements  with our third-party  providers  and\\nstrategic  partners.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  these  agreements  will  be  effective  in  controlling  access  to,  and  use  and  distribution  of,  our  platform  and  proprietary\\ninformation. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our\\nofferings. Competitors and other third parties may also attempt to reverse engineer our data which would compromise our trade secrets and other rights. We also enter into\\nstrategic partnerships, joint development and other similar agreements with third parties where intellectual property arising from such partnerships may be jointly-owned or\\nmay be transferred or licensed to the counterparty. Such arrangements may limit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or commercialize such intellectual property rights,\\nincluding requiring agreement with or payment to our joint development partners before protecting, maintaining, licensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectual\\nproperty rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such intellectual property rights in a manner that may affect the\\nvalue of the jointly-owned intellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.\\nWe  may  be  required  to  spend  significant  resources  in  order  to  monitor  and  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights,  and  some  violations  may  be  difficult  or\\nimpossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the\\nimpairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits\\nattacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology against unauthorized\\ncopying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions\\nof enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or harm our reputation or brand. In addition, we may be\\nrequired to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings or platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable terms\\nor at all and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\\nOur industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, particularly regarding autonomous vehicle technology, including by foreign actors.\\nWe, along with others in our industry, have been the target of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future. Although we\\ntake measures to protect our property, if we are unable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments may be undermined\\nand our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with\\nsuch  laws  and  regulations  or  any  other  obligations  relating  to  privacy,  data  protection  or  the  protection  or  transfer  of  personal  data,  could  adversely  affect  our\\nbusiness.\\nWe  receive,  transmit  and  store  a  large  volume  of  personally  identifiable  information  and  other  data  relating  to  the  users  on  our  platform.  Numerous  local,\\nmunicipal, state, federal and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of certain\\ntypes of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of\\nNon-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S. Federal Health Insurance\\nPortability  and Accountability  Act of 1996, or HIPAA, Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and the\\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which becomes operative on January 1, 2023. These laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continually\\nchange, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the\\nCPRA will require new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information.\\nThe CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcement\\nremain unclear. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies and\\nincur additional compliance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, other states have considered or have enacted legislation similar to the CCPA and CPRA. For example,\\non March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or CDPA, which becomes effective on January 1, 2023, and on June 8, 2021, Colorado\\nenacted the Colorado Privacy Act, or CPA, which takes effect on July 1, 2023. These new and modified state laws, including the CPRA, and other changes in laws or\\nregulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of certain\\ntypes of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our offerings, require\\n43\\nsignificant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing certain offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in the\\nfuture.\\nFurther, as we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional privacy-related laws and regulations. For example, in\\nconnection with the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division to Woven Planet, we have entered into certain data sharing and other agreements with Woven Planet to\\nfacilitate and accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology. Changes in the law or regulatory landscape could limit or prohibit activities in this regard.\\nFurther,  the  collection  and  storage  of  data  in  connection  with  the  use  of  our  Concierge  and  Lyft  Pass  for  Healthcare  offerings  by  healthcare  partners  subjects  us  to\\ncompliance requirements under HIPAA. HIPAA and its implementing regulations contain requirements regarding the use, collection, security, storage and disclosure of\\nindividuals’ protected health information, or PHI. In 2009, HIPAA was amended by the HITECH Act to impose certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements\\ndirectly  upon  business  associates  of  covered  entities.  Contracted  healthcare  entities  including  healthcare  providers,  health  plans,  and  transportation  brokers  using  our\\nConcierge or Lyft Pass for Healthcare offerings are either covered entities or business associates under HIPAA. We must also comply with HIPAA as we use and disclose\\nthe PHI of riders in our capacity as a business associate of other contracted healthcare entities. Compliance obligations under HIPAA include privacy, security and breach\\nnotification obligations, and could subject us to increased liability for any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI determined to be a “breach.” If we knowingly breach the\\nHITECH Act’s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to civil penalties that range from $100 -\\n$50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum per violation calendar year cap of $1.5 million for “willful neglect” violations and the possibility of civil litigation.\\nAdditionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information security\\nstandards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRA\\nimposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we\\nmay face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort\\nto do so. In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our healthcare customers under our agreements with them. As\\nwe consider expansion of business offerings and markets and as laws and regulations change, we expect to incur additional costs related to privacy, data protection and\\ninformation security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or contractual obligations related to such offerings and face additional risks\\nthat such expansion could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of such laws, regulations or obligations.\\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible that\\nour practices, offerings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or\\nthe failure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information\\nsecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personally identifiable information or other driver or rider data, or the\\nperception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing drivers and riders from using\\nour platform or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of concerns relating to privacy, data protection or information security, whether or\\nnot valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course\\nof  business,  including  those  involving  personal  injury,  property  damage,  worker  classification,  labor  and  employment,  anti-discrimination,  commercial  disputes,\\ncompetition, consumer complaints, intellectual property disputes, compliance with regulatory requirements, securities laws, and other matters, and we may become subject\\nto additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations and legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new offerings such as\\nautonomous vehicle technology, Driver Centers and Mobile Services, Lyft Auto Care, our network of Light Vehicles and deliveries,  including proceedings related to\\nproduct  liability  or  our  acquisitions,  securities  issuances  or  business  practices.  We  are  also  regularly  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  arbitration  proceedings,  government\\ninvestigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings seeking to hold us liable for the actions of independent contractor drivers on our platform. See the section titled\\n“Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations or other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with\\ncertainty.  Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  time-consuming,  result  in  costly  litigation,  be  harmful  to  our  reputation,  require  significant\\nmanagement attention and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant\\nsubjective  judgment  and speculation.  It  is possible that  a resolution  of  one or more  such proceedings  could  result  in substantial  damages, settlement  costs,  fines and\\npenalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These proceedings could also\\n44\\nresult in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions or other orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences\\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations\\nto indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business, commercial, and government partners and current and former directors and officers.\\nA determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that involves our industry, could harm our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a determination that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, whether we are party\\nto such determination or not, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.\\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders on our platform. These provisions are intended to\\nstreamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However,\\narbitration may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to\\ncertain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation and\\nbrand, we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could\\nincrease our litigation costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees.\\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federal\\nlaw, there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our\\narbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase\\nin our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs we expand our platform offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws\\nand  regulations  or  manage  the  increased  costs  associated  with  such  laws  and  regulations  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of\\noperations.\\nAs we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from one\\njurisdiction to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or\\naddress the unique issues faced by our industry.\\nFor example, contracting with healthcare entities and transportation brokers representing healthcare entities may subject us to certain healthcare related laws and\\nregulations. These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on us and our platform in providing access to rides through the Lyft Platform on behalf of\\nhealthcare partners. Additional requirements may arise related to the collection and storage of data and systems infrastructure design, all of which could increase the costs\\nassociated  with  our  offerings  to  healthcare  partners.  With  respect  to  our  healthcare  rides  matched  through  the  Lyft  Platform  and  provided  to  Medicaid  or  Medicare\\nAdvantage beneficiaries, we are subject to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws that impose penalties for violations. Significant violations of such laws could lead to our\\nloss of Medicaid provider enrollment status, and could also potentially result in exclusion from the federal programs as an authorized transportation platform provider.\\nFurther, we may in certain circumstances be or become considered a government contractor with respect to certain of our services, which would expose us to certain risks\\nsuch as the government’s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector’s budgetary cycles and funding authorization, and the government’s administrative and\\ninvestigatory processes.\\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to our platform offerings, it is possible that our practices, offerings or\\nplatform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-\\nparty providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to our platform offerings, could harm our reputation and brand,\\ndiscourage new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform, lead to refunds of rider fares or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies or private\\nclaims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws.\\nFor example, the TCPA restricts certain telemarketing and the use of certain automated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted and may in the future\\nresult in civil claims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and\\ndeveloping. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n45\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial\\nstatements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the\\nlisting standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required\\nto be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms\\nand that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are\\nalso continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to\\nmaintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including increased\\ncomplexity resulting from any international expansion, the expanded work-from-home practices of our employees in response to COVID-19 and permanent work-from-\\nhome and hybrid work arrangements, new offerings on our platform or from strategic transactions, including acquisitions and divestitures. Further, weaknesses in our\\ndisclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties\\nencountered  in  their  implementation  or  improvement,  could  harm  our  results  of  operations  or  cause  us  to  fail  to  meet  our  reporting  obligations  and  may  result  in  a\\nrestatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely\\naffect  the  results  of  periodic  management  evaluations  and  annual  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  attestation  reports  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  our\\ninternal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over\\nfinancial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market price of our\\nClass A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\\nOur independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an\\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar taxes and\\nmay successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to businesses like ours and\\nto drivers is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and\\nare subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to\\ndrivers’ businesses.\\nIn addition, local governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative\\naction to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. For example, it is becoming more common for local governments to impose per trip fees specifically on\\nTNC rides. As one example, voters in San Francisco approved “Proposition D” in November of 2019, which imposes a percentage-based tax on TNC rides originating in\\nthe city. Such taxes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and\\nwe may face indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities have raised\\nand may continue to raise questions about or challenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes, and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions\\nin which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and interest. A successful assertion by one or more tax\\nauthorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes,\\ncould result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past transactions, as well as penalties and interest, and could discourage drivers and riders from utilizing our\\nofferings or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax\\nliabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.\\nAdditionally,  one  or  more  states,  localities  or  other  taxing  jurisdictions  may  seek  to  impose  additional  reporting,  record-keeping  or  indirect  tax  collection\\nobligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,\\ncollect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place\\n46\\nover the Internet, and are considering related legislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain states have enacted laws that\\nwould require tax reporting, collection or tax remittance on items sold online. Requiring tax reporting or collection could decrease driver or rider activity, which would\\nharm our business. New legislation may require us or drivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection and\\nremittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any such\\ndifference may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is\\ndetermined.\\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our management\\nteam have limited experience managing a public company.\\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the\\nreporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the\\nrules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, we file annual,\\nquarterly and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and\\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial\\ncompliance  costs,  and  increase  demand  on  our  systems.  In  addition,  as  a  public  company,  we  may  be  subject  to  stockholder  activism,  which  can  lead  to  additional\\nsubstantial  costs,  distract  management  and  impact  the  manner  in  which  we  operate  our  business  in  ways  we cannot  currently  anticipate.  As a  result  of  disclosure  of\\ninformation in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation,\\nincluding by competitors.\\nCertain  members  of  our  management  team  have  limited  experience  managing  a  publicly  traded  company,  interacting  with  public  company  investors  and\\ncomplying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a\\npublic company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and\\ninvestors. These obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day\\nmanagement of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\\nWe have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, and requiring our suppliers to ensure the\\nefficient use of raw materials, water, and energy resources via our Supplier Code of Conduct, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever\\nbusiness is conducted. For example, our San Francisco, California headquarters is projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity and sea level rise due to climate\\nchange, as well as climate-related events including wildfires and associated power shut-offs. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather\\nevents and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of our\\ncustomers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate\\nchange policies such as California’s Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program, which imposes greenhouse gas and EV requirements on our industry, and failure to meet\\nthe future requirements could have adverse impacts on our costs and ability to operate in California, as well as public goodwill towards our company. We advocate for EV\\nprograms that can be efficiently accessed by drivers on our platform and rental car operators, and any failure of such programs to address EV capital costs, EV charging\\ncosts, and EV charging infrastructure in the context of transportation network companies’ unique needs could challenge our ability to progress toward our 100% EV\\ncommitment. Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance,\\ndepreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not\\nsuccessful, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. We may also enter into arrangements with third\\nparties for financing, leasing or otherwise, to enable us to meet our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030. Such transactions may require us to\\nprovide guarantees for financing. We may also benefit from certain tax credits for EVs and, if such tax credits expire or are terminated or we are otherwise unable to use\\nthem, we may not realize the benefits we have planned and our business and financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\\nRisks Related to Financing and Transactional Factors\\nWe may require additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\\nHistorically, we funded our capital-intensive operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our operations. To\\nsupport our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our offerings, including potential new offerings. In May 2020,\\nwe issued $747.5 million in aggregate principal amount\\n47\\nof our 2025 Notes and, from time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, including by the issuance of securities. If we raise additional funds through the\\nissuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, such as our 2025 Notes, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our Class A\\ncommon  stock,  and  our  existing  stockholders  may  experience  dilution.  Further,  we  have  secured  debt  financing  which  has  resulted  in  fixed  obligations  and  certain\\nrestrictive covenants, and any debt financing secured by us in the future would result in increased fixed obligations and could involve additional restrictive covenants\\nrelating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, as well as liens on some or all of our assets, which may make it more difficult for us to\\nobtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\\nWe evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business\\nplans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Additionally, COVID-19 may impact our access to capital and\\nmake additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable\\nterms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business\\ngrowth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do not achieve\\nour objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\\nAs  part  of  our  business  strategy,  we  will  continue  to  consider  a  wide  array  of  potential  strategic  transactions,  including  acquisitions  of  businesses,  new\\ntechnologies,  services  and  other  assets  and  strategic  investments  that  complement  our  business,  such  as  our  acquisition  of  Flexdrive  in  February  2020,  as  well  as\\ndivestitures, partnerships and other transactions. We have previously acquired and continue to evaluate targets and other opportunities that operate in relatively nascent\\nmarkets. As we grow, we also may explore investments in new technologies, which we may develop or other parties may develop. We may also explore acquisitions, joint\\nventures,  or  other  strategic  partnerships  that  result  in  our  products  or  services  entering  new  markets.  There  is  no  assurance  that  such  acquired  businesses  will  be\\nsuccessfully integrated into our business or generate substantial revenue, that our investments in other technologies will generate returns for our business, or that we will\\nnot lose our initial investment with strategic investments.\\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\\n•\\nintense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase acquisition costs and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or\\nacceptable terms;\\n•\\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\\n•\\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\\n•\\nour ability to successfully obtain indemnification or representation and warranty insurance;\\n•\\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company;\\n•\\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\\n•\\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\\n•\\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\\n•\\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual\\nproperty, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\\n•\\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business;\\n•\\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\\n•\\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new offerings cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\\n•\\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.\\nIn addition, we may divest businesses or assets or enter into joint ventures, strategic partnerships or other strategic transactions. For example, in July 2021, we\\nclosed  the  sale  of  our  Level  5  self-driving  vehicle  division.  These  types  of  transactions  present  certain  risks;  for  example,  we may  not  achieve  the  desired  strategic,\\noperational  and financial benefits of a divestiture,  partnership, joint venture or other strategic  transaction.  Further, during the pendency of a divestiture or during the\\nintegration or\\n48\\nseparation process of any strategic transaction, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of employees, customers, or suppliers.\\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services and\\nother assets, strategic investments or other transactions, or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, or if we are unable to successfully complete\\nother transactions or such transactions do not meet our strategic objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\\nServicing our current and future debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness.\\nOur payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our\\nbusiness or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\\nIn May 2020, we issued our 2025 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Flexdrive, which\\nis now a wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender, a\\nMaster Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender and a Vehicle Procurement Agreement, as amended, with a third-\\nparty; and, following the acquisition, we continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed under these agreements. See Note 10 \"Debt\" to our\\nconsolidated financial statements, for further information on these agreements and our outstanding debt obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had $711.4 million of\\nindebtedness for borrowed money outstanding.\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject\\nto economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our\\ndebt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets,\\nrestructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any existing or future\\nindebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these\\nactivities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that\\nmay prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could\\nresult in the acceleration of our debt.\\nIn  addition,  our  indebtedness,  combined  with  our  other  financial  obligations  and  contractual  commitments,  could  have  other  important  consequences.  For\\nexample, it could:\\n•\\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government\\nregulation;\\n•\\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\\n•\\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\\n•\\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and\\n•\\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.\\nFurther,  as  of  January  1,  2022,  LIBOR  settings  for  all  non-U.S.  dollar  currencies  and  U.S.  dollar  one-week  and  two-month  LIBOR  settings  ceased  being\\npublished, provided or representative. InterContinental Benchmark Exchange and the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority have confirmed that LIBOR settings\\nfor all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will cease to be published, provided or representative after June 30, 2023. If new methods of calculating LIBOR are established\\nor if other benchmark rates used to price indebtedness or investments are established, the terms of any existing or future indebtedness or investments, including the terms of\\nFlexdrive’s debt instruments, may be negatively impacted, resulting in increased interest expense or lower than expected interest income.\\nIn addition, under certain of our and our subsidiary’s existing debt instruments, we and Flexdrive are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants\\nregarding our business and operations, including limitations on Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions.\\nIf we or Flexdrive, as applicable, do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, and do not obtain a waiver or consent from the lenders,\\nthen, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve\\nadditional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain\\nadditional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our\\nloans immediately, and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\\n49\\nAny of these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our\\nbusiness and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\\nIn  connection  with  the  issuance  of  our  2025  Notes,  we  entered  into  the  capped  call  transactions,  or  Capped  Calls.  The  option  counterparties  are  financial\\ninstitutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will\\nnot be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an\\noption counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time\\nunder the Capped Calls with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an\\nincrease  in  the  market  price  and  in  the  volatility  of  our  Class  A  common  stock.  In  addition,  upon  a  default  by  an  option  counterparty,  we  may  suffer  adverse  tax\\nconsequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or\\nviability of the option counterparties.\\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $7.5 billion of federal and $6.7 billion of state net operating losses (“NOLs”) available to reduce future taxable income, which\\nwill begin to expire in 2030 for federal and 2022 for state purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use NOLs before their expiration, or at\\nall. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-\\nchange NOLs to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5-\\npercent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our ability to use net operating losses\\nto reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes that may occur in the\\nfuture.\\nThe Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, among other things, includes changes to the rules governing\\nour U.S. Federal NOLs. NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 are subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation (as calculated before taking the\\nNOLs into account) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, NOLs arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are subject to a five-year carryback and\\nindefinite carryforward, while NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 also are subject to indefinite carryforward but cannot be carried back. Not all\\nstates conform to the Tax Act or CARES Act and some states have varying conformity to the Tax Act or CARES Act. In future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is\\nrecognized related to our NOLs, the changes in the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our valuation\\nallowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2017.\\nRisks Related to Governance and Ownership of our Capital Stock Factors\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome\\nof important transactions, including a change in control.\\nOur Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued and\\noutstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Accordingly, Logan Green, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors holds\\napproximately 21.42% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and President and Vice Chair of our board of directors, holds\\napproximately 12.63% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, will be able to significantly influence\\nmatters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of\\nall or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our Co-Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may vote\\nin a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change\\nin control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company and might\\nultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Each Co-Founder’s voting power is as of December 31, 2021 and includes shares of Class A common\\nstock expected to be issued upon the vesting of such Co-Founder’s RSUs within 60 days of December 31, 2021.\\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited\\nexceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of\\nClass A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii)\\nthe date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the shares of Class B common stock held by our\\nCo-Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of the Class B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permitted\\nentities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last to die or become\\ndisabled of our Co-Founders, or such\\n50\\nlater date not to exceed a total period of 18 months after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.\\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on our stock price.\\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or\\nother adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of\\ntheir indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital\\nstructures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up\\nthe S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures\\nand temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices; however, in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with\\nunequal voting structures” in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our dual\\nclass capital structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to\\npassively track those indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are still fairly new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the\\nvaluations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companies\\nthat are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not\\ntake similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely\\npreclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A\\ncommon stock could be adversely affected.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our\\ncontrol. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of\\nour Class A common stock include the following:\\n•\\nprice  and  volume  fluctuations  in  the  overall  stock  market  from  time  to  time,  including  fluctuations  due  to  general  economic  uncertainty  or  negative  market\\nsentiment, in particular related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n•\\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks generally, or those in our industry, including fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to\\nthe operating performance of those technology companies;\\n•\\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\\n•\\nsales or purchases of shares of our Class A common stock by us, our officers, or our significant stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales or purchases\\ncould occur;\\n•\\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these\\nestimates or the expectations of investors;\\n•\\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\\n•\\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features;\\n•\\ninvestor sentiment and the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC, or those of our competitors or others in\\nour industry;\\n•\\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\\n•\\nshort selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;\\n•\\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\\n•\\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\\n•\\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\\n•\\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\\n•\\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;\\n51\\n•\\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or statements by public officials regarding potential new\\nlaws or regulations;\\n•\\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\\n•\\nany significant change in our management or our board of directors; and\\n•\\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action\\nlitigation has often been instituted against these companies. For example, as disclosed above, beginning in April 2019, several putative class actions have been filed in\\nCalifornia state and federal courts and derivative actions have been filed in Delaware and California federal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, and\\ncertain  of  the  underwriters  named  in  our  IPO  Registration  Statement  alleging  violation  of  securities  laws,  breach  of  fiduciary  duties,  and  other  causes  of  action  in\\nconnection with our IPO. Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them, such matters could result in substantial\\ncosts and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales have or could occur, could depress the market price of our Class A\\ncommon stock.\\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market, and the\\nperception that these sales have or could occur may also depress the market  price of our Class A common stock, including if there is short-selling  or other hedging\\ntransactions.\\nWe have filed a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of\\napplicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediate\\nresale in the United States in the open market.\\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These\\nsales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy\\ncontest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.\\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in\\ncontrol by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the\\nperson became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of\\nincorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\\n•\\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws require the approval of at least two-thirds of our\\nthen-outstanding voting power;\\n•\\nour dual class common stock structure, which provides our Co-Founders, individually or together, with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters\\nrequiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common\\nstock;\\n•\\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\\n•\\nour stockholders are only able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and are not able to take action by written consent for any matter;\\n•\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\\n•\\nvacancies on our board of directors are able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\\n•\\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or a majority of\\nour board of directors;\\n•\\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\\n52\\n•\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be\\nissued without further action by our stockholders; and\\n•\\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also\\ndiscourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of\\nwhich, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also\\naffect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us\\nand our stockholders and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under\\nthe Securities Act, each of which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole\\nand exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our\\ndirectors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended\\nand restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be\\nthe Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases\\nsubject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the\\nUnited States are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions.\\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other\\nemployees,  which  may  discourage  lawsuits  against  us  and  our  directors,  officers  and  other  employees.  If  a  court  were  to  find  the  exclusive-forum  provisions  in  our\\namended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions,\\nwhich could harm our results of operations.\\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they change their\\nrecommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business,\\nour market or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts\\nwho cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors or\\npublish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these securities analysts cease coverage of\\nus or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and\\ntrading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of\\nour business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock\\nafter price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\\nNone.\\nItem 2.

This\\nsection of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of fiscal year 2019 and year-\\nto-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\nResults of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. This discussion contains forward-\\nlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the\\nsection titled “Risk Factors” and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected\\nfor any period in the future.\\nFinancial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2021\\n•\\nTotal revenue was $3.2 billion, an increase of 36% year-over-year.\\n•\\nTotal costs and expenses were $4.3 billion, including stock-based compensation expense of $724.6 million and insurance costs related to changes to insurance\\nreserves attributable to historical periods of $250.3 million.\\n•\\nLoss from operations was $1.1 billion.\\n•\\nOther income was $135.9 million, including a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of the gain on the transaction with Woven Planet.\\n•\\nNet loss was $1.0 billion, a decrease of 42% and 61% compared to 2020 and 2019, respectively.\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA was $92.9 million, marking the Company’s first annual Adjusted EBITDA profit.\\n•\\nCash used in operating activities was $101.7 million.\\n•\\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.\\nImpact of COVID-19 to our Business\\nThe  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  impact  communities  in  the  United  States,  Canada  and  globally.  Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,\\ngovernments and private businesses - at the recommendation of public health officials - have enacted precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel\\nrestrictions  and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  home\\nprograms and limited the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for our\\nplatform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19\\npandemic.\\nAlthough we have seen some signs of demand improving as COVID-19 case counts trended down, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the\\npandemic, demand levels continue to be affected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The\\nextent to which our  operations  will  continue to be impacted  by the pandemic  will depend  largely  on future  developments,  which  are highly  uncertain  and cannot be\\naccurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities\\nand private businesses to contain the pandemic or recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused\\nmany businesses to delay employees returning to the office. Even as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders are modified or lifted, we anticipate that continued social\\ndistancing, altered consumer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration of\\nthese challenges cannot be presently estimated.\\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements for\\nridesharing  and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcount\\nreductions in 2020.\\n56\\nWe have strengthened our business over the last year and we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate this challenging period. In 2021, we saw continued\\nrecovery as vaccines were more widely distributed and more communities fully reopened, which resulted in revenue increasing 36% in 2021 compared to the prior year,\\nand the number of Active Riders increasing 49.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net loss decreased $743.5 million, or 42%, from\\n$1.8 billion in 2020 to $1.0 billion in 2021, which included a benefit from a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million from the transaction with Woven Planet. Adjusted EBITDA in\\n2021  was  $92.9  million,  marking  our  first  annual  Adjusted  EBITDA  profitability.  We  remain  focused  on  our  long-term  growth  opportunities.  With  $2.3  billion  in\\nunrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2021, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to continue business operations and to\\ntake action we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, stockholders, stakeholders and of drivers and riders on the Lyft Platform. For more information on\\nrisks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I.\\nRecent Developments\\nTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (“Woven Planet”)\\nOn July 13, 2021, we completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets\\nrelated to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate the safety and\\ncommercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. We will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with this\\ntransaction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.\\nThe divestiture did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as a\\ndiscontinued operation. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of our transaction with Woven Planet, which was included in other income, net on the\\nconsolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Refer to Note 4 \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial statements for information\\nregarding the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.\\nReinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liability Insurance\\nOn April 22, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. (“PVIC”), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement (the\\n“Reinsurance Agreement”) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (“DARAG”), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based on reserves in\\nplace as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded to\\nDARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with an\\naggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (“the Reinsurance Transaction”). The Reinsurance Agreement arrangement does not discharge PVIC of\\nits obligations to the policyholder. A loss of approximately $20.4 million for the net cost of the Reinsurance Transaction was recognized on the consolidated statement of\\noperations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.\\nActive Riders and Revenue per Active Rider\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decrease in Active Riders and in revenue per Active Rider beginning March 2020. Though we experienced a\\nrecovery in revenue per Active Rider and the number of Active Riders in 2021, the number of Active Rider levels have not reached levels we experienced prior to the onset\\nof the pandemic in March 2020. The number of Active Riders is a key indicator of the scale of our community and awareness of our brand. Revenue per Active Rider\\nrepresents our ability to drive usage and monetization of our platform.\\nActive Riders\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2020 to 2021 %\\nChange\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n(in thousands, except for dollar amounts and percentages)\\nThree Months Ended March 31\\n13,494\\n21,211\\n20,503\\n(36.4)%\\n3.5%\\nThree Months Ended June 30\\n17,142\\n8,688\\n21,807\\n97.3%\\n(60.2)%\\nThree Months Ended September 30\\n18,942\\n12,513\\n22,314\\n51.4%\\n(43.9)%\\nThree Months Ended December 31\\n18,728\\n12,552\\n22,905\\n49.2%\\n(45.2)%\\n57\\nRevenue per Active Rider\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2020 to 2021 %\\nChange\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\nThree Months Ended March 31\\n$45.13\\n$45.06\\n$37.86\\n0.2%\\n19.0%\\nThree Months Ended June 30\\n$44.63\\n$39.06\\n$39.77\\n14.3%\\n(1.8)%\\nThree Months Ended September 30\\n$45.63\\n$39.94\\n$42.82\\n14.2%\\n(6.7)%\\nThree Months Ended December 31\\n$51.79\\n$45.40\\n$44.40\\n14.1%\\n2.3%\\nWe define Active Riders as all riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active Rider is identified by\\na unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter,\\nthat person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a single\\nActive Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Riders\\nunless the ride is accessible in the Lyft App. Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.\\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account. Accordingly,\\nLyft updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider’s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to access\\ntheir ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, all\\nConcierge riders were excluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.\\nWith the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, Active Riders in each of the three month\\nperiods  ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2021  increased  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  as  vaccines  were  more  widely  distributed  and  more\\ncommunities fully reopened. Active Riders in the three months periods ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020 represented significantly lower Active Rider\\ncounts since shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions were first implemented across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The\\nslight decrease in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarily\\nto the increasing COVID-19 case counts from COVID-19 variants and their impact on demand as well as the seasonality we typically experience in the winter months.\\nRevenue per Active Rider increased in each of the three months periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2021 as compared to the same\\nperiods in 2020, primarily reflecting the improvement in demand on our platform compared to earlier periods during the COVID-19 pandemic, which had materially\\nlimited people\\'s mobility and severely reduced Active Riders. Revenue per Active Rider reached an all-time high in the three months ended December 31, 2021, increasing\\ncompared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. This was driven by an increase in ride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airport\\nrides, reflecting the increased travel experienced in the fourth quarter in 2021 nationwide. Revenue per Active Rider also benefited from revenues from licensing and data\\naccess agreements, beginning in the second quarter of 2021.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with\\nGAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\\nrevenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable\\nunder the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our\\nfuture financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.\\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most\\ncritical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 of the notes to our\\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\\nWe generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We recognize revenue from fees paid by drivers for\\nuse of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Drivers enter into terms of\\nservice (“ToS”) with us in order to use our Lyft Driver App.\\n58\\nWe provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers to\\nfind, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our single\\nperformance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.\\nWe evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to the\\nrider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to a\\nrider (the driver’s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to provide a transportation service to their\\ncustomer through use of the Lyft Platform. While we facilitate setting the price for transportation services, the drivers and riders have the discretion in accepting the\\ntransaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportation\\nservices. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.\\nWe report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from the\\nrider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers to\\nprovide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control the\\nprovision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.\\nWe consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract exists\\nbetween the driver and us when the driver’s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related charges from riders\\non behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement to\\ndrivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.\\nWe earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amount\\nearned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do not\\ncontrol the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fully\\nmitigated. We earn a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-front\\nquoted fare offered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.\\nWe recognize revenue upon completion of a ride as the single performance obligation is satisfied and we have the right to receive payment for the services\\nrendered upon the completion of the ride.\\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if we\\ncannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\\nIn some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to request\\nrides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a percentage of the\\nride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.\\nWe recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over the\\napplicable subscription period.\\nWe generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling our promise to provide rideshare data and access to\\nFlexdrive vehicles and bear the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. We act as a principal in delivering the data and access\\nlicenses and present revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery and vehicle access, are determined by assigning the\\nrelative fair value to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as\\nour  respective  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  upon  the  delivery  of  each.  Refer  to  Note  4  \"Divestitures\"  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  information\\nregarding the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.\\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\\nWe generate rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, our network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Under the Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals programs, we\\noperate a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. We either lease or sublease vehicles to\\ndrivers and Lyft Rentals renters, as a result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. For\\nvehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Drivers\\nwho rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which we collect from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft Platform.\\n59\\nRevenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicles riders are recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive\\nand Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light\\nVehicle transactions, we classify these rentals as operating leases.\\nInsurance Reserves\\nWe utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or\\nreinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under\\nstate law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been\\nincurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined on\\na quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of\\nloss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with\\nclaims reserve valuations.\\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make certain\\nassumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as one of the most significant assumptions, and utilize\\nactuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open,\\neconomic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate\\nthat differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while we\\nbelieve that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts that will\\nultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets.\\nWe continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and the\\nlegal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe incur stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (“PSUs”), stock options and stock purchase rights granted under\\nour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).\\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing\\nmodel. The fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We\\nrecognize compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.\\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs are estimated based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to our IPO is\\ndetermined based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to our IPO, we granted RSUs which vest upon the satisfaction of\\nboth a service condition and a performance condition.\\nCompensation  expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  the\\nperformance  condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.  The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of  our  IPO\\nRegistration Statement on March 28, 2019. On that date we recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the accelerated attribution\\nmethod for the RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to these\\nRSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction of a\\nservice-based condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost\\nrelated to RSUs was $587.5 million, which we expect to recognize over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchase\\nconsideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\\nassumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed\\none year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information\\nis obtained related to facts and\\n60\\ncircumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.\\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.\\nIntangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by us based on the fair value of assets\\nreceived. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.\\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances\\nindicate the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine\\nwhether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its\\ncarrying amounts, the quantitative impairment test will be required. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently issued accounting pronouncements not\\nyet adopted as of the date of this report. \\nComponents of Results of Operations\\nAs noted above, we expect to see decreased levels of demand for our platform, decreased numbers of new rider activations, and negative impacts on revenue for so\\nlong as responsive measures to COVID-19 remain in place when compared to levels prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. We have adopted\\nmultiple measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain that these actions will mitigate some or all of the negative effects of the pandemic on our\\nbusiness. In light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financial\\nand operating results in future periods.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our\\nConcierge offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from our vehicle service centers and revenue from\\nlicensing and data access agreements. Revenue derived from these offerings are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 as described in the Critical Accounting Policies\\nand Estimates above and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue also consists of rental revenues recognized through leases or subleases primarily from Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and our network of Light Vehicles, which\\nincludes revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by riders of Light Vehicles. Revenue derived from these offerings are recognized in accordance with ASC 842 as\\ndescribed in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if we\\ncannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\\nCost of Revenue\\nCost of revenue consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through our multimodal platform which primarily includes insurance costs,\\npayment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing and bike and scooter\\nrentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers in California. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges. Other\\ncosts  included  in  cost  of  revenue  are  hosting  and  platform-related  technology  costs,  vehicle  lease  expenses,  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  depreciation,\\namortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges and remarketing gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.\\nOperations and Support\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email and\\nchat  support  to  users,  bike  and  scooter  fleet  operations  support  costs,  driver  background  checks  and  onboarding  costs,  fees  paid  to  third-parties  providing  operations\\nsupport, facility costs and certain car rental fleet support costs. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other customer\\nsupport activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.\\nResearch and Development\\n61\\nResearch  and  development  expenses  primarily  consist  of  personnel-related  compensation  costs  and  facilities  costs.  Such  expenses  include  costs  related  to\\nautonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nOn July 13, 2021, we completed a transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our\\nself-driving vehicle division, Level 5, and as a result, certain costs related to our prior initiative to develop self-driving systems were eliminated beginning in the third\\nquarter of 2021.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders,\\nadvertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral  and  administrative  expenses  primarily  consist  of  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  professional  services  fees,  certain  insurance  costs  that  are\\ngenerally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative fees, policy\\nspend, depreciation, facility costs and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.\\nInterest Expense\\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest incurred on our 2025 Notes, as well as the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and debt discount.\\nInterest expense also includes interest incurred on our Non-Revolving Loan and our Master Vehicle Loan.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of a pre-tax gain as a result of the transaction with Woven Planet, interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents,\\nsublease income and restricted and unrestricted short-term investments.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nOur provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions and U.S. state income taxes. As we expand the scale of our international\\nbusiness activities, any changes in the U.S. and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our overall provision for income taxes in the future.\\nWe have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. We expect to maintain this\\nvaluation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized.\\n62\\nResults of Operations\\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations data:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n(in thousands)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n3,208,323 \\n$\\n2,364,681 \\n$\\n3,615,960 \\nCosts and expenses\\nCost of revenue\\n1,649,532 \\n1,447,516 \\n2,176,469 \\nOperations and support\\n402,233 \\n453,963 \\n636,116 \\nResearch and development\\n911,946 \\n909,126 \\n1,505,640 \\nSales and marketing\\n411,406 \\n416,331 \\n814,122 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n915,638 \\n946,127 \\n1,186,093 \\nTotal costs and expenses\\n4,290,755 \\n4,173,063 \\n6,318,440 \\nLoss from operations\\n(1,082,432)\\n(1,808,382)\\n(2,702,480)\\nInterest expense\\n(51,635)\\n(32,678)\\n— \\nOther income, net\\n135,933 \\n43,669 \\n102,595 \\nLoss before income taxes\\n(998,134)\\n(1,797,391)\\n(2,599,885)\\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\\n11,225 \\n(44,534)\\n2,356 \\nNet loss\\n$\\n(1,009,359)\\n$\\n(1,752,857)\\n$\\n(2,602,241)\\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nRevenue\\n100.0 %\\n100.0 %\\n100.0 %\\nCosts and expenses\\nCost of revenue\\n51.4 \\n61.2 \\n60.2 \\nOperations and support\\n12.5 \\n19.2 \\n17.6 \\nResearch and development\\n28.4 \\n38.4 \\n41.6 \\nSales and marketing\\n12.8 \\n17.6 \\n22.5 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n28.5 \\n40.0 \\n32.8 \\nTotal costs and expenses\\n133.7 \\n176.5 \\n174.7 \\nLoss from operations\\n(33.7)\\n(76.5)\\n(74.7)\\nInterest expense\\n(1.6)\\n(1.4)\\n— \\nOther income, net\\n4.2 \\n1.8 \\n2.8 \\nLoss before income taxes\\n(31.1)\\n(76.0)\\n(71.9)\\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\\n0.3 \\n(1.9)\\n0.1 \\nNet loss\\n(31.5)%\\n(74.1)%\\n(72.0)%\\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\\nRevenue \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020 to 2021 %\\nChange\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n3,208,323 \\n$\\n2,364,681 \\n$\\n3,615,960 \\n36 %\\n(35) %\\nRevenue increased $843.6 million, or 36%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the significant increase in the number of Active Riders in\\n2021 as compared to the prior year, as vaccines became more widely distributed and more communities reopened. Revenue in 2021 also benefited from revenues from\\nlicensing and data access agreements, beginning in the\\n63\\nsecond quarter of 2021. These increases were offset by investments in driver supply by increasing driver incentives recorded as a reduction to revenue by $942.9 million in\\n2021 as compared to the prior year as rider demand outpaced driver supply during certain periods of the pandemic recovery in 2021. Revenue in 2020 was also higher in the\\nfirst quarter of 2020 prior to the implementation of shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions across North America beginning March 2020.\\nWe expect to see continued recovery in demand for our platform and the resulting positive impacts on revenue as there are more widespread immunity levels,\\nmore communities  reopen and other restrictive  travel and social distancing measures in response to COVID-19 are eased. However, we cannot  predict  the impact  of\\nCOVID variants and the longer term impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior.\\nCost of Revenue\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020 to 2021 %\\nChange\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n1,649,532 \\n$\\n1,447,516 \\n$\\n2,176,469 \\n14 %\\n(33) %\\nCost of revenue increased $202.0 million, or 14%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $160.6 million in\\ninsurance costs driven by increased rider demand. Insurance costs were also impacted by (i) an increase of $46.2 million attributable to changes in estimates to the liabilities\\nfor insurance required by regulatory agencies, (ii) a $20.2 million increase in transaction costs related to the reinsurance of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities in the\\nsecond quarter of 2021, and (iii) a $62.5 million decrease in transaction costs related to the transfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities from the first quarter of 2020.\\nIn addition, there was an increase of $48.4 million in transaction fees and $14.9 million in bikes and scooter related costs driven by the increased ride volume as a result of\\nincreased  demand  as  recovery  from  the  pandemic  continued.  These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  a  $31.4  million  decrease  in  costs  related  to  Flexdrive  and  a\\n$13.4 million decrease in web-hosting fees to support our platform.\\nOperations and Support\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020 to 2021 %\\nChange\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nOperations and support\\n$\\n402,233 \\n$\\n453,963 \\n$\\n636,116 \\n(11) %\\n(29) %\\nOperations and support expenses decreased $51.7 million, or 11%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of\\n$18.3 million in driver onboarding costs and rider and driver support costs and a reduction of $14.7 million in personnel-related costs. There was also a $13.1 million\\ndecrease in costs related to Flexdrive and a $6.5 million net decrease related to costs from the restructuring event in the second quarter of 2020, consisting of severance and\\nbenefits costs, lease termination costs and a stock-based compensation benefit which did not recur in 2021.\\nResearch and Development\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020 to 2021 %\\nChange\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nResearch and development\\n$\\n911,946 \\n$\\n909,126 \\n$\\n1,505,640 \\n— %\\n(40) %\\nResearch and development expenses increased $2.8 million in 2021.

These increases were offset by a $37.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs and a $4.6 million decrease in autonomous vehicle research costs\\nwhich were\\n64\\nimpacted by our transaction with Woven Planet in the third quarter of 2021.

There was also an $18.9 million decrease in office-related costs, personnel-related costs, and other employee-related expenses primarily as a\\nresult of the restructuring events in 2020 and our temporary remote work option for many employees beginning in the middle of March 2020. These decreases were\\npartially  offset  by  a  $32.2  million  increase  in  stock-based  compensation,  a  $28.1  million  increase  in  an  accrual  for  self-retained  general  business  liabilities  and  a\\n$16.5 million increase in certain loss contingencies including legal accruals and settlements.

For more information regarding our use of these measures\\nand a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\\nContribution and Contribution Margin\\nContribution  and Contribution Margin are measures  used by our management  to understand  and evaluate  our operating  performance  and trends. We believe\\nContribution and Contribution Margin are key measures of our ability to achieve profitability and increase it over time. Contribution Margin has generally increased over\\nthe periods presented as revenue has increased at a faster rate than the costs included in the calculation of Contribution.\\nWe define Contribution as revenue less cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude the following items from cost of revenue:\\n•\\namortization of intangible assets;\\n•\\nstock-based compensation expense;\\n•\\npayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\\n•\\nchanges to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\\n•\\ntransaction costs related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities, if any; and\\n•\\nrestructuring charges, if any.\\nFor more information about cost of revenue, see the section titled “Components of Results of Operations—Cost of Revenue.”\\nContribution Margin is calculated by dividing Contribution for a period by revenue for the same period.\\nWe record changes to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies for financial reporting purposes in the quarter of positive or adverse\\ndevelopment even though such development may be related to claims that occurred in prior periods. For example, if in the first quarter of a given year, the cost of claims\\ngrew by $1 million for claims related to the prior fiscal year or earlier, the expense would be recorded for GAAP purposes within the first quarter instead of in the results of\\nthe prior period. We believe these prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations since these prior\\nperiod changes relate to claims that could potentially date back years. We have limited ability to influence the ultimate development of historical claims. Accordingly,\\nincluding the prior period changes would not illustrate the performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is run or managed by us. For consistency, we do not\\nadjust the calculation of Contribution for any prior period based on any positive or adverse development that occurs subsequent to the quarter end. Annual Contribution is\\ncalculated by adding Contribution of the last four quarters. We believe the adjustment to exclude changes to the historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory\\nagencies from Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period\\nresults.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, we entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement for the reinsurance of legacy auto insurance liabilities between October\\n1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, based on the reserves in place as of March 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a Novation Agreement for the transfer of\\ncertain  legacy  auto  insurance  liabilities  between  October  1,  2015  and  September  30,  2018.  Refer  to  Note  6  “Supplemental  Financial  Statement  Information”  to  the\\nconsolidated  financial  statements  for  information  regarding  these  transactions.  We  believe  the  costs  associated  with  these  transactions  related  to  certain  legacy  auto\\ninsurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations despite this transaction occurring in the current period because the impacted\\ninsurance liabilities relate to claims that date back years. We believe the adjustment to exclude these costs associated with transactions related to legacy insurance liabilities\\nfrom Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period results and\\nprovide for better comparability with our historically disclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA amounts.\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n66\\nLosses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement that exceed the combined funds withheld liability balance and collateralized amount established by DARAG for\\nthe benefit of PVIC, which was $346.5 million at the execution of the Reinsurance Agreement, but are below the aggregate limit of $434.5 million may result in the\\nrecognition of a deferred gain liability. When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are uncertain, the recovery method should be used. The deferred gain\\nliability would be amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlement\\nperiod of the ceded reserves will be based on the life-to-date cumulative losses collected and will likely extend over periods longer than a quarter. The amount of the\\ndeferral  will  be  recalculated  each  period  based  on  loss  payments  and  updated  estimates.  Consequently,  cumulative  adverse  development  for  claims  ceded  under  the\\nReinsurance Agreement in subsequent periods may result in significant losses to the statement of operations unless the deferred gain amortization recognized in the same\\nperiod to offset said losses. We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement,\\nincluding any related adverse development and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be excluded to show the ultimate economic benefit of the\\nReinsurance Agreement. This adjustment will help investors understand the economic benefit of our Reinsurance Agreement on future trends in our operations, as they\\nimprove  over  the  settlement  period  of  any  deferred  gains.  Additionally,  net  amounts  recognized  for  claims  ceded  under  the  Reinsurance  Agreement  would  represent\\nchanges to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies. As stated above, we believe prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the\\ncurrent period performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is managed. This is because we have limited ability to influence the ultimate development of\\nthese historical claims, which can potentially date back years. Therefore, in the event that the net amount of any adverse developments and any benefits from deferred gains\\nrelated to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement is recognized on the statement of operations in a subsequent period, those amounts will be excluded from the\\ncalculation of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical\\nperiods. As of December 31, 2021, there have been no such net amounts related to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement which have impacted our consolidated\\nstatement of operations.\\nWe had restructuring efforts in the second and fourth quarters of 2020 to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic\\nchallenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business. We believe the costs associated with the restructuring do not reflect current period\\nperformance of our ongoing operations. We believe the adjustment to exclude the costs related to restructuring from Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to\\ninvestors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period results and provide for better comparability with our historically\\ndisclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA amounts.\\nFor more information regarding the limitations of Contribution and Contribution Margin and a reconciliation of revenue to Contribution, see the section titled\\n\"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operating\\nleverage in our business. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more\\nconsistent basis, we use these measures for business planning purposes. We expect Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin will increase over the long term as we\\ncontinue to scale our business and achieve greater efficiencies in our operating expenses.\\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for:\\n•\\ninterest expense;\\n•\\nother income (expense), net;\\n•\\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes;\\n•\\ndepreciation and amortization;\\n•\\nstock-based compensation expense;\\n•\\npayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\\n•\\nchanges to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\\n•\\nsublease income;\\n•\\ncosts related to acquisitions and divestitures, if any;\\n•\\ntransaction costs related to certain legacy auto insurance liability, if any; and\\n•\\nrestructuring charges, if any.\\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period.\\n67\\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, we entered into subleases for certain offices as part of the transaction with Woven Planet. Sublease income is included within\\nother income on our consolidated statement of operations, while the related lease expense is included within our operating expenses and loss from operations. Sublease\\nincome was immaterial prior to the third quarter of 2021. We believe the adjustment to include sublease income to Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling\\nthem to better assess our operating performance, including the benefits of recent transactions, by presenting sublease income as a contra-expense to the related lease charges\\nwithin our operating expenses.\\nFor more information regarding the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, see the\\nsection titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\\n68\\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nWe  use  Contribution,  Contribution  Margin,  Adjusted  EBITDA  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  Margin  in  conjunction  with  GAAP  measures  as  part  of  our  overall\\nassessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and\\nto communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore\\ncomparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these measures have certain limitations in that they do\\nnot include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business. Thus, our Contribution,\\nContribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared\\nin accordance with GAAP.\\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA to the related GAAP financial measures, revenue and\\nnet  loss, respectively.

The total impact of the transaction to reinsure\\ncertain legacy auto insurance liabilities on our consolidated statement of operations was $20.4 million, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expense\\nin the year ended December 31, 2021.\\n(7)\\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we transferred certain legacy auto insurance liabilities. The total impact of the transfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities on our consolidated statement of\\noperations was $64.7 million, with $62.5 million in cost of revenue and $2.2 million in general and administrative expense in the year ended December 31, 2021.\\n(8)\\nIncluded in restructuring charges is $32.9 million of severance and other employee costs and $2.6 million related to lease termination and other restructuring costs.

This  consisted  primarily  of  a  net  loss  of  $1.0  billion  and  a\\n$119.3 million pre-tax gain from the transaction with Woven Planet. This was offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $724.6 million and depreciation and\\namortization expense of $139.3 million.\\nCash used in operating activities was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. This consisted primarily of a net loss of $1.8 billion and a decrease in the\\ninsurance reserve of $391.4 million primarily related to the transfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities in the first quarter of 2020. This was offset by non-cash\\nstock-based compensation expense of $565.8 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $157.4 million.\\nInvesting Activities\\nCash provided by investing activities was $267.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which primarily consisted of proceeds from sales and maturities\\nof marketable securities of $3.8 billion and maturities of term deposits of $675.5 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $3.8 billion and term\\ndeposits of $0.5 billion.\\nCash provided by investing activities was $740.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of proceeds from sales and maturities\\nof marketable securities of $5.4 billion and maturities of term deposits of $645.6 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $4.1 billion and term\\ndeposits of $1.1 billion.\\nFinancing Activities\\nCash used in financing activities was $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which primarily consisted of repayment of loans of $44.4 million and\\nprincipal payments on finance lease obligations for $35.5 million.\\nCash provided by financing activities was $512.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of proceeds from issuance of our 2025\\nNotes of $734.1 million offset by the purchase of the Capped Calls for $132.7 million.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents  of approximately  $457.3 million and short-term investments  of\\napproximately $1.8 billion, exclusive of restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of institutional money market\\nfunds, certificates of deposits, commercial paper and corporate bonds that have an original maturity of less than three months and are readily convertible into known\\namounts of cash. Also included in cash and cash equivalents are certain money market deposit accounts and cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit\\ncard transactions. Short-term investments consisted of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and term deposits, which mature in 12 months or less.\\nRestricted cash, cash equivalents and investments consisted primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance\\npurposes and amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.\\nWe collect the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers at the time the ride is delivered using the rider’s authorized payment method, and we retain\\nany fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement to drivers. Accordingly, we maintain no accounts receivable from drivers. Our contracts with insurance\\nproviders require reinsurance premiums to be deposited into trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which the insurance providers are reimbursed for\\nclaims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.\\nWe continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in March 2020, the pandemic and responses thereto contributed to a severe\\ndecrease in the number of rides on our platform and revenue which had a significant effect on our cash flows from operations. While conditions have improved, these\\nimpacts are ongoing. The extent to which our operations,\\n71\\nfinancial results and financial condition will be impacted in the next few quarters by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain\\nand cannot be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, new information about additional variants, the availability and efficacy of vaccine distributions,\\nadditional or renewed actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or respond to its impact and altered consumer behavior, among\\nother things. We have adopted several measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safety requirements for\\nridesharing, and updating workplace policies. We also made adjustments to our expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenues including the transaction with\\nWoven Planet completed on July 13, 2021 and headcount reductions in 2020. Refer to Note 4 \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial statements for information\\nregarding the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.\\nWe cannot be certain that our actions will mitigate some or all of the continuing negative effects of the pandemic on our business. With $2.3 billion in unrestricted\\ncash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  believe  we  have  sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  our  working  capital  and  capital\\nexpenditures needs for the next 12 months and beyond.\\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability to maintain profitability on an Adjusted EBITDA\\nbasis, our ability to attract and retain drivers and riders on our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our\\nefforts to develop our platform, actual insurance payments for which we have made reserves, measures we take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to\\nmaintain demand for and confidence in the safety of our platform during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. As\\nnoted above, we expect to see continued suppression of demand for our platform and the resultant negative impacts on revenue for so long as the travel restrictions and\\nother social distancing measures in response to COVID-19 remain in place. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses,\\nproducts,  services  and  technologies.  For  example,  we  intend  to  significantly  invest  further  into  EVs  in  order  to  achieve  compliance  with  the  California  Clean  Miles\\nStandard and Incentive Program which sets the target that 90% of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. Our investment also allows us to make\\nsteps toward our commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund\\ncapital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations, or to refinance our existing or future indebtedness. In the event that we decide, or are\\nrequired, to seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital\\nwhen desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):\\nPayments Due by Period\\nTotal\\n12 months or less\\nThereaft\\nOperating lease commitments\\n$\\n317.8 \\n$\\n67.6 \\n$\\nFinancing lease commitments\\n28.7 \\n14.0 \\nLong-term debt, including current maturities\\n711.5 \\n56.3 \\nOther noncancelable agreements\\n120.3 \\n46.8 \\n_______________\\n(1)\\nThe table excludes insurance reserves due to uncertainties in the timing of settlement of these reserves.\\nWe  did  not  have  during  the  periods  presented,  and  we  do  not  currently  have,  any  off-balance  sheet  financing  arrangements  or  any  relationships  with\\nunconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the\\npurpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\\n(1)\\n72\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates. Such fluctuations to date have not\\nbeen significant.\\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $2.3 billion, which consisted primarily of\\ninstitutional  money market  funds, certificates  of deposits,  commercial  paper, corporate  bonds, and  term  deposits, which each carry  a degree of interest  rate risk, and\\nrestricted cash, cash equivalents and restricted investments of $1.1 billion. A hypothetical 100 basis points change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our\\nfinancial condition or results of operations due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio.\\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had long-term debt of $711.4 million, 85% of which consisted of the fixed-rate Convertible Senior Notes we issued in May 2020. A\\nhypothetical 100 basis points change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to immateriality.\\n73\\nItem 8.

We also have\\naudited the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\\n31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting\\nprinciples  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.  Also  in  our  opinion,  the  Company  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effective  internal  control  over\\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing\\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting\\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over\\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\\nthe amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining\\nan  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating\\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\\nof the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\\ndirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n75\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated\\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)\\ninvolved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.  The  communication  of  critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the\\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit\\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance,\\nwhich may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage,\\nfirst party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. As of December 31, 2021, insurance\\nreserves totaled $1,069 million. Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors\\nas one of the most significant assumptions and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis through an\\nanalysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs and\\nassumptions.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) the\\nsignificant judgment by management when developing the estimated insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\\nperforming procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves; (ii) the significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarial\\nvaluation methods and the loss development factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves, including the controls over the development of\\nthe actuarial valuation methods and the loss development factors. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and\\nknowledge  to  assist  in  developing  an  independent  estimate  of  the  insurance  reserves  for  certain  reserve  segments  and  comparison  of  this  independent  estimate  to\\nmanagement’s  actuarially  determined  reserves.  Developing  the  independent  estimate  involved  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  historical  data  provided  by\\nmanagement, and independently developing loss development factors.\\nValuation of Certain Elements of the Transaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (“Woven Planet”)\\nAs described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota\\nMotor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company’s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization\\nof Lyft rideshare and fleet data. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfront\\nand  $350  million  to  be  paid  over  a  five-year  period.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  management  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangement\\nconsideration was attributable to the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division and how much was attributable to the commercial agreements for the\\nutilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certain\\nassets related to the Level 5 division, which was based on the fair value of the Level 5 division assets, valued under the replacement cost method, and the estimated\\nstandalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued using an adjusted market approach. The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used to\\nestimate the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the standalone\\nselling price of the rideshare data.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain elements of the transaction with Woven Planet is\\na critical audit matter are (i) a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and\\nestimated standalone selling price of the rideshare data due to the significant judgment by management when determining the values; (ii) the significant audit effort in\\nevaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve and the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license; and\\n(iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\n76\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the transaction with Woven Planet, including controls over the Company’s valuation\\nmethods, significant assumptions and data. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the transaction agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for\\ndeveloping the fair value estimate of the Level 5 division assets and estimating the standalone selling price of the rideshare data; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the\\nvaluation methods; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the obsolescence curve and the estimated miles used to\\nrecreate the data produced from the rideshare license. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumption related to the obsolescence curve involved\\nconsidering the estimated life of comparable acquired technology. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumption related to the estimated miles\\nused  to  recreate  the  data  produced  from  the  rideshare  license  assumption  involved  considering  other  comparable  data  licensing  agreements  as  well  as  assessing  for\\nconsistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s\\nvaluation methods and the reasonableness of the obsolescence curve and estimated miles assumptions.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Francisco, California\\nFebruary 28, 2022\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015.\\n77\\nLyft, Inc.\\nConsolidated Balance

Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\\nOrganization and Description of Business\\nLyft,  Inc.  (the  “Company”  or  “Lyft”)  is  incorporated  in  Delaware  with  its  headquarters  in  San  Francisco,  California.  The  Company  operates  multimodal\\ntransportation  networks  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  that  offer  access  to  a  variety  of  transportation  options  through  the  Company’s  platform  and  mobile-based\\napplications. This network enables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers who have a vehicle with\\nriders  who  need  a  ride.  The  Lyft  Platform  provides  a  marketplace  where  drivers  can  be  matched  with  riders  via  the  Lyft  App  where  the  Company  operates  as  a\\ntransportation network company (“TNC”).\\nTransportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connects\\ndrivers and riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada, Lyft’s network of Light Vehicles, the Express Drive program, where drivers can enter into\\nshort-term  rental  agreements  with  Flexdrive  or  a  third  party  for  vehicles  that  may  be  used  to  provide  ridesharing  services  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  and  Lyft  Rentals,  a\\nconsumer offering for users who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use, and Lyft Driver Centers and Lyft Auto Care, where drivers and riders can\\nrequest auto maintenance and collision repair services offered through the Lyft Platform in certain markets.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and\\ninclude the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nThe Company uses the U.S. dollar predominantly  as the functional  currency of its foreign subsidiaries. For foreign subsidiaries  where the U.S. dollar is the\\nfunctional currency, gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency balances into U.S. dollars are included on the consolidated statements of operations. For the\\nforeign subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded to a\\nseparate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\\nInitial Public Offering\\nThe Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (the “IPO Registration Statement”) related to its initial public offering (“IPO”) was declared effective on\\nMarch 28, 2019, and the Company’s Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 29, 2019. On April 2, 2019, the Company\\ncompleted its IPO, in which the Company sold 32,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $72.00 per share. On April 9, 2019, the Company\\nsold an additional 2,996,845 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $72.00 per share pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase\\nadditional shares. The Company received aggregate net proceeds of $2.5 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $70.3 million and offering\\nexpenses of $7.7 million subject to certain cost reimbursements.\\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, 219,175,709 shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock then outstanding converted into an equivalent\\nnumber of shares of common stock. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which\\nauthorizes a total of 18,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 100,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, and 1,000,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Upon the\\nfiling of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 255,007,393 shares of the Company’s common stock then outstanding were automatically reclassified into\\nan  equivalent  number  of  shares  of  the  Company’s  Class  A  common  stock.  Immediately  after  the  reclassification  and  prior  to  the  completion  of  the  IPO,  a  total  of\\n12,779,709 shares of Class A common stock held by Logan Green, John Zimmer and their respective affiliated trusts were exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of\\nClass B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As a result, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has two classes of authorized\\nand outstanding common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses\\nduring the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience,\\nexpected future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are\\nnot readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\n85\\nSignificant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial instruments, goodwill\\nand identifiable intangible assets, leases, indirect tax obligations, legal contingencies, valuation allowance for deferred income taxes, and the valuation of stock-based\\ncompensation.\\nBeginning in the middle of March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) in the United States, Canada, and globally has impacted the Company’s\\nbusiness. The Company continues to be impacted by COVID-19, but the long-term impact will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and\\ncannot be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, new information about additional variants, the availability and efficacy of vaccine distributions,\\nadditional or renewed actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or respond to its impact and altered consumer behavior, among\\nother things. The Company has adopted a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safety\\nrequirements for ridesharing and updating workplace policies. The Company also made adjustments to its expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenues\\nincluding headcount reductions in 2020. Refer to Note 17 “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the 2020 restructuring events.\\nThe  Company  cannot  be  certain  that  these  actions  will  mitigate  the  negative  effects  of  the  pandemic  on  Lyft\\'s  business.  As  of  the  date  of  issuance  of  the  financial\\nstatements, the Company is not aware of any material event or circumstance that would require it to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of the\\nCompany\\'s assets or liabilities, including the recording of any credit losses. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and\\ncould lead to impairment of long lived assets or goodwill, or credit losses associated with investments or other assets, and the impact of such changes on estimates will be\\nrecognized on the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be\\nmaterial to the Company\\'s financial statements.\\nSegment Information\\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief\\nOperating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive\\nOfficer is the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating\\nresources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment. During the years ended December 31,\\n2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have material\\nassets located outside of the United States.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nThe Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft Platform\\nand mobile-based applications. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is generated from its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders and is recognized\\nin accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”). In addition, the Company generates revenue in accordance with ASC 606 from licensing\\nand data access, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies. The Company also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles and\\nLyft Rentals, which is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (“ASC 842”).\\nThe table below presents the Company\\'s revenues as included on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nRevenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606)\\n$\\n2,957,979 $\\n2,208,656 \\n$\\n3,465,473 \\nRental revenue (ASC 842)\\n250,344 \\n156,025 \\n150,487 \\nTotal revenue\\n$\\n3,208,323 $\\n2,364,681 \\n$\\n3,615,960 \\n86\\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\\nThe Company recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606. The Company generates revenue from service fees and commissions\\n(collectively, “fees”) paid by drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete rides via the Lyft\\nApp  where  the  Company  operates  as  a  TNC.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  completion  of  each  ride.  Drivers  enter  into  terms  of  service  (“ToS”)  with  the\\nCompany in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform\\nand related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver to\\nprovide a transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the gross\\namount collected from the rider.\\nAs the Company’s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver’s ability to cancel the ride lapses, which\\ntypically is upon pickup of the rider. The Company’s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a\\nsuccessful transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion of\\nthe ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and\\nretains its fees before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.\\nThe Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over the\\napplicable subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services in accordance with\\nASC 606.\\nThe Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide rideshare\\ndata and access to Flexdrive vehicles and bears the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. The Company is acting as a\\nprincipal in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery and\\nvehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratably\\nover the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as the Company’s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.\\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\\nThe Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Rental revenues are recognized for rental and\\nrental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.\\nThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. The\\nCompany either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, as\\napplicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,\\nas applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft\\nPlatform.\\nDue to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenue\\ngenerated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals is\\nrecognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less.\\nEnterprise and Trade Receivables\\nThe Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider’s authorized payment method. Uncollected fees are\\nincluded  in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  current  assets  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  represent  receivables  from  (i)  participants  in  the  Company’s  enterprise\\nprograms (“Enterprise Users”), where the transactions have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have either been invoiced or are unbilled as of\\nthe reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not yet settled with third-party payment processors. Under\\nthe ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related charges\\nit collects from riders on behalf of drivers. Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers. The portion of the fare receivable to be remitted to drivers is\\nincluded in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected. As a result of the adoption of\\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses\" (“ASC 326”), the Company’s measurement of the allowance for credit losses has been\\naugmented to reflect the change from the incurred loss\\n87\\nmodel to the expected credit loss model. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise and\\ntrade receivables balance. In determining the expected credit losses, the Company considers its historical  loss experience, the aging of its receivable balance, current\\neconomic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodically\\nand as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.\\nThe Company’s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $196.2 million, $104.7 million and $120.0 million as of\\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company\\'s allowance for credit losses was $9.3 million, $15.2 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021,\\n2020 and 2019, respectively. The write-offs were immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in the allowance for credit losses for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs. The change in the allowance for credit\\nlosses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs. The change in\\nthe allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million of\\nwrite-offs.\\nIncentive Programs\\nThe Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cash\\nincentives while riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters generally receive free or discounted rides under such incentive programs. Incentives provided to\\ndrivers, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not the\\nCompany’s customers, incentives provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.\\nDriver Incentives\\nThe Company offers various incentive  programs to drivers, including minimum guaranteed  payments, volume-based  discounts and performance-based  bonus\\npayments.  These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  The\\nCompany reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the most\\nlikely outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Company\\ndoes not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives for\\nreferring new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or the\\nestablished fair value of the benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.\\nRideshare Rider Incentives\\nThe Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentive\\nprograms are as follows:\\n(i)\\nMarket-wide marketing promotions. Market-wide promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.\\nThis type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by the\\ndriver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction to\\nrevenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.\\n(ii)\\nTargeted marketing promotions. Targeted marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders. An example is\\na promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of time\\nto a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides are\\nsimilar to marketing coupons. These incentives differ from the market-wide marketing promotions because they do not reduce the overall pricing of the\\nservice  provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.  During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.  These\\nincentives represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of the\\nincentive is recorded as sales and marketing expense.\\n(iii)\\nRider referral programs. Under the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completes\\ntheir first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the corresponding\\ncharge recorded to sales and marketing expense. Referral coupons typically expire within one year. The Company estimates breakage using its historical\\nexperience. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.\\n88\\nLight Vehicle Rider and Lyft Rentals Renter Incentives\\nIncentives offered to Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, in relation to the driver, rider, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters incentive programs, the\\nCompany recorded $1.3 billion, $390.8 million and $560.3 million as a reduction to revenue and $64.7 million, $135.0 million and $381.5 million as sales and marketing\\nexpense, respectively.\\nRefunds\\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to riders unsatisfied by the level of service provided by the driver. There is no legal obligation to\\nremunerate such riders nor does the Company issue such credits or refunds to riders on behalf of the drivers. The Company accounts for credits or refunds, which are not\\nrecoverable from the drivers as sales and marketing expenses when incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, rider refunds were $19.1 million,\\n$18.8 million and $33.9 million, respectively. The Company accounts for credits and refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders as cost of revenue and was $6.5 million for the\\nyear ended December 31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders were not material.\\nCost of Revenue\\nCost  of  revenue  consists  of  costs  directly  related  to  revenue  generating  transactions  through  the  Company’s  multimodal  platform  which  primarily  includes\\ninsurance costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing and\\nbike and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges.\\nOther costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, vehicle lease expenses, personnel-related compensation costs, depreciation,\\namortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.\\nOperations and Support\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email and\\nchat support to users, bike and scooter fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, facility cost, certain car rental fleet support costs, and\\nfees paid to third-parties providing operations support. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other customer support\\nactivities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs related to the\\nCompany’s autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders,\\nadvertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $145.4\\nmillion, $102.5 million and $188.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral  and  administrative  expenses  primarily  consist  of  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  professional  services  fees,  certain  insurance  costs  that  are\\ngenerally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative fees, policy\\nspend, depreciation, facility costs, and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThe Company incurs stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, PSUs, stock options, and ESPP purchase rights.\\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-\\npricing model. The Black-Scholes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards. These variables include:\\n•\\nper share fair value of the underlying common stock;\\n89\\n•\\nexercise price;\\n•\\nexpected term;\\n•\\nrisk-free interest rate;\\n•\\nexpected annual dividend yield; and\\n•\\nexpected stock price volatility over the expected term.\\nThe Company estimates the expected term for stock options using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” stock option awards. The expected term of the ESPP\\npurchase rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period. Since the Company has limited history as a\\npublic company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company\\'s common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP purchase\\nrights using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury\\nzero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted.\\nThe fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The\\nCompany recognizes compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.\\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to the IPO is\\ndetermined based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to the IPO, the Company granted RSUs which vest\\nupon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition.\\nCompensation  expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  the\\nperformance  condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.  The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of the  IPO\\nRegistration Statement on March 28, 2019. On that date the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the accelerated\\nattribution method for the RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related\\nto these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction of\\na service-based condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\\nStock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant\\nand revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on\\nthe estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using\\nthe enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes the effect on\\ndeferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to\\nthe net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of\\nincome, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\\nUnder the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all positions taken\\nby the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be\\nrecognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on\\nthe technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expense\\nline in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value\\nof purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair\\nvalue of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and\\nliabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value are based\\nupon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result,\\n90\\nactual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the\\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the\\nacquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Acquisition\\ncosts, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as well as commercial paper and corporate\\nbonds. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Also\\nincluded in cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, which was immaterial as of each of December 31,\\n2021 and 2020, and money market deposit accounts that are stated at cost, which approximate fair value.\\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance purposes\\nand amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.\\nInvestments\\nDebt Securities\\nThe Company’s accounting for its investments in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company’s intended holding period for the security,\\nand  the  nature  of  the  transaction.  Investments  in  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  corporate  bonds  and  U.S.  government  securities.\\nInvestments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.\\nThe Company considers an available-for-sale debt security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis. The entire\\ndifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the consolidated statements of operations\\nas an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the security\\nbefore recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. In\\nmaking this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-party\\nrating agencies, and adverse conditions specific to the security, among other factors. If the Company\\'s assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the credit loss is\\nmeasured based on the Company\\'s best estimate of the cash flows expected to be collected. When developing its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, the\\nCompany  considers  all  available  information  relevant  to  the  collectability  of  the  security,  including  past  events,  current  conditions,  and  reasonable  and  supportable\\nforecasts.\\nCredit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheet\\nwith an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment to\\nthe amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of December 31, 2021, the Company\\nhad not recorded any credit impairments. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification method.\\nThe Company\\'s investments in debt securities include:\\n(i)\\nCash  and  cash  equivalents. Cash  equivalents  include  certificates  of  deposits,  commercial  paper  and  corporate  bonds  that  have  an  original\\nmaturity of 90 days or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\\n(ii)\\nShort-term investments. Short-term investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which mature\\nin twelve months or less. As a result, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\\n(iii)\\nRestricted investments. Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate\\nbonds and U.S. government securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insurance\\nproviders.\\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\\nThe Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of\\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators of impairment exist.\\nFactors considered in this assessment include the investees’ financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, exposure to industries and markets impacted by\\nCOVID-19, and the time\\n91\\nsince  the  last  adjustment  to  fair  value,  among  others.  If  an  impairment  exists,  the  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  by  using  the  best  information\\navailable, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value\\nof the investment on the consolidated statements of operations.\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash\\nwith multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash\\nequivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities to\\ninvestment-grade securities.\\nFair Value Measurements\\nThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an\\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would\\nuse in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring\\nor nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair\\nvalue:\\nLevel 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\\nLevel 2 Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs\\nother than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by\\ncorrelation or other means.\\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be\\nconsistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\\nThe carrying values of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time to\\npayment.\\nLight Vehicle Fleet\\nThe Company’s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters. Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid expenses\\nand other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the scooters, which is\\nless than 12 months. As of December 31, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service. As of December 31, 2020, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was\\n$8.9 million. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of scooters placed\\nin service was not material. Depreciation expense related to scooters was $5.9 million, $7.2 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and\\n2019, respectively. Bikes are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nLeases\\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach with an effective date as of the beginning of the fiscal year, January 1, 2019. The\\nCompany elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward the historical assessments of\\n(1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is or\\ncontains a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset. The\\nCompany determines the classification and measurement of its leases upon lease commencement. The Company enters into certain agreements as a lessor and either leases\\nor subleases the underlying asset in the agreement to customers. The Company also enters into certain agreements as a lessee. If any of the following criteria are met, the\\nCompany classifies the lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or sales-type lease (both as a lessor):\\n•\\nThe lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;\\n•\\nThe lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;\\n•\\nThe lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of the economic\\nlife of the underlying asset;\\n•\\nThe present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or\\n•\\nThe underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.\\n92\\nLeases that do not meet any of the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases.\\nLessor\\nThe Company\\'s lease arrangements include vehicle rentals to drivers or renters under the Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals programs and Light Vehicle rentals to single-\\nuse riders. Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease\\ncomponents, such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized as\\nrevenue in the period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with each\\nlease revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements. The Company mitigates\\nresidual value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on the\\nCompany\\'s ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions.\\nLessee\\nThe Company\\'s leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services on\\nthe Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use asset\\nand lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain\\nthat the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected to\\ndo so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-\\nuse assets and lease liabilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.\\nThe Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease\\npayments based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Company\\nwould have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\\nLease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Company’s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are included in\\noperating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities — current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease costs for the Company\\'s\\noperating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net,\\naccrued and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the\\nestimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. The interest component of finance leases is included in\\ncost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognized\\nprimarily in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of\\nthe  related  asset,  which  is  generally  between two and  seven  years.  Depreciation  for  property  and  equipment  commences  once  they  are  ready  for  our  intended  use.\\nMaintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost\\nand accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations in the\\nperiod realized. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease, or the useful life of the assets. Construction in\\nprogress is related to property and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use.\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.\\nIntangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based on management’s estimate of the fair value of\\nassets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.\\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances\\nindicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first performs a qualitative\\nassessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the\\nCompany’s  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  quantitative  impairment  test  will  be  required.  Alternatively,  the  Company  may  bypass  the  qualitative\\nassessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\\n93\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nThe  Company  reviews  long-lived  assets,  including  property  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets,  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  business\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such events and changes may include: significant changes in performance\\nrelative to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business strategy. The Company measures\\nrecoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the\\ncarrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. There\\nwas no impairment of long-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nThe Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems. The Company capitalizes development costs related to the Lyft\\nPlatform and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to\\nperform the function intended. The Company capitalized $16.2 million and $12.8 million of software development costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and\\n2020, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, capitalized software development costs was not material.\\nInsurance Reserves\\nThe Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to\\ninsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection\\nunder state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have\\nbeen  incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.  Liabilities  are\\ndetermined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and\\napplication of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-\\nparty actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.\\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and the Company has limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, the\\nCompany makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as one of the most significant\\nassumptions, and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the\\nclaim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a\\nprior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.\\nHowever, while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a\\nresult, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for on\\nthe consolidated balance sheets. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional\\nclaims are reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.\\nNet Loss Per Share\\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities.\\nThe two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated\\nand participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common\\nstock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company’s redeemable\\nconvertible preferred stock contractually entitles the holders of such shares to participate in dividends but does not contractually require the holders of such shares to\\nparticipate in the Company’s losses. There were no redeemable convertible preferred shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares\\nsubject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the\\nCompany reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common\\nstockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.\\n94\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\", which removes certain\\nexceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending\\nexisting guidance. Effective on January 1, 2021, the Company adopted this standard, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and\\nrelated disclosures.\\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, \"Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323),\\nand Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815\", which clarifies the interaction of the accounting for\\nequity securities under Topic 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting under Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts\\nand purchased options accounted for under Topic 815. Effective on January 1, 2021, the Company adopted this standard, which did not have a material impact on the\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nIn  October  2020,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2020-10,  “Codification  Improvements”,  which  updates  various  Codification  Topics  by  clarifying  or  improving\\ndisclosure requirements to align with the SEC’s regulations, and improving the consistency of the Codification to ensure all guidance that requires or provides an option for\\nan entity to provide information in the notes to financial statements is codified in the Disclosure Section of the Codification. Effective on January 1, 2021, the Company\\nadopted this standard, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn  August  2020,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2020-06,  “Debt—Debt  with  Conversion  and  Other  Options  (Subtopic  470-20)  and  Derivatives  and  Hedging—\\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”, which simplifies the accounting\\nfor convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required\\nto be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the\\nseparation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new\\nstandard  also  removes  certain  settlement  conditions  that  are  required  for  contracts  to  qualify  for  equity  classification  and  simplifies  the  diluted  earnings  per  share\\ncalculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted earnings per share calculations.\\nThis new standard will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company\\nwill adopt  this standard effective  January 1, 2022, using the modified  retrospective  method. In  the consolidated  balance  sheets, the adoption  of this new guidance is\\nestimated to result in:\\n•\\nan increase of approximately $134 million to the total carrying value of the convertible senior notes to reflect the full principal amount of the convertible notes\\noutstanding net of issuance costs,\\n•\\na reduction of approximately $140 million (net of tax) to additional paid-in capital to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features\\nassociated with the convertible notes, and\\n•\\na cumulative-effect adjustment of approximately $7 million (net of tax) to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2022.\\nIn  October  2021,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2021-08,  “Business  Combinations  (Topic  805):  Accounting  for  Contract  Assets  and  Contract  Liabilities  from\\nContracts with Customers”, which requires companies to apply the definition of a performance obligation under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\\nto recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities relating to contracts with customers that are acquired in a business combination.

Acquisitions\\nAcquisition of Flexdrive Services, LLC (“Flexdrive”)\\nOn February 7, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of Flexdrive for approximately $20.0 million and treated the acquisition as a\\nbusiness combination. The acquisition is expected to contribute to the growth of the Company\\'s current business, and help expand the range of the Company\\'s use cases.\\nPrior to the acquisition, the Company acted as the lessee of Flexdrive’s vehicles and sublessor for each vehicle prior to its rental by drivers. As of the Closing Date, the\\nCompany had approximately $133.1 million of operating lease right-of-use assets and $130.1 million of operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet related to this\\npreexisting contractual relationship with Flexdrive. This preexisting contractual relationship and others were settled on the Closing Date as an adjustment to the purchase\\nprice, resulting in a total acquisition consideration paid of $13.0 million.\\n95\\nAcquisition costs were immaterial and are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Closing Date (in thousands):\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n587 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n276 \\nProperty and equipment\\n111,881 \\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\n56,014 \\nIdentifiable intangible assets - developed technology\\n13,200 \\nTotal identifiable assets acquired\\n181,958 \\nLoans\\n134,121 \\nFinance lease & other liabilities\\n57,265 \\nTotal liabilities assumed\\n191,386 \\nNet liabilities assumed\\n(9,428)\\nGoodwill\\n22,455 \\nTotal acquisition consideration\\n$\\n13,027 \\nGoodwill  represents  the  excess  of  the  total  purchase  consideration  over  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  Goodwill  is\\nattributable to expected synergies and monetization opportunities from gaining control over the Flexdrive platform (“developed technology” intangible asset) and gaining\\ngreater flexibility in monetizing the fleet of owned and leased vehicles from the combined operations of the Company and Flexdrive. The acquisition is a taxable business\\ncombination for tax purposes and goodwill recognized in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.\\nThe fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $13.2 million with an estimated useful life of three years. The fair value of the\\ndeveloped technology was determined using the avoided cost approach. In the avoided cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the future after-tax costs which\\nare avoided (or reduced) as a result of owning (or having the rights to) the asset for three years after the Closing Date. Indications of value were developed by discounting\\nthese benefits to their present value.\\nThe results of operations for the acquired business have been included on the consolidated statements of operations for the period subsequent to the Company\\'s\\nacquisition  of  Flexdrive.  Flexdrive\\'s  results  of  operations  for  periods  prior  to  this  acquisition  were  not  material  to  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  and,\\naccordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented.\\nOther Acquisitions\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed two business combinations which are not material to the consolidated financial statements.\\nPro  forma  results  of  operations  have  not  been  presented  because  the  effects  of  the  acquisitions  were  not  material  to  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial\\nstatements.\\n4. Divestitures\\nTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (“Woven Planet”)\\nOn July 13, 2021, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain\\nassets related to the Company’s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate the\\nsafety and commercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in\\nconnection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.\\nThe  divestiture  did  not  represent  a  strategic  shift  with  a  major  effect  on  the  Company’s  operations  and  financial  results,  and  therefore,  does  not  qualify  for\\nreporting  as  a  discontinued  operation.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  the  Company  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangement  consideration  was\\nattributable to the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division and how much was attributable to the commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft\\nrideshare and fleet data. The Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division, which was based on the\\nrelative fair value of the Level 5 division, valued under the replacement cost method, and the estimated standalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued using\\nan adjusted market approach.. The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used to estimate the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and the estimated\\nmiles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the stand alone selling price of the rideshare data. The gain was included in other income,\\nnet on\\n96\\nthe consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. The commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data by\\nWoven Planet is accounted for under ASC 606 and the Company recorded a deferred revenue liability of $42.5 million related to the performance obligations under these\\ncommercial agreements as part of the transaction at closing. The Company also derecognized $3.4 million in assets held for sale.\\n97\\n5.

The term deposits are at cost, which approximates fair\\nvalue.\\nThe weighted-average  remaining  maturity  of the Company’s investment  portfolio  was less than one year as of the periods presented.  No individual  security\\nincurred continuous unrealized losses for greater than 12 months.\\nThe Company purchases investment grade marketable debt securities which are rated by nationally recognized statistical credit rating organizations in accordance\\nwith its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize the Company\\'s exposure to credit losses. As of December 31, 2021, the credit-quality of the Company’s\\nmarketable available-for-sale debt securities had remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31,\\n2021 was primarily related to the continued market volatility associated with COVID-19. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the\\nsecurities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments and it is not expected that the investments would be settled at a price less than their amortized cost\\nbasis. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of\\ntheir amortized cost basis. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to change its assessment of credit losses for\\nany marketable available-for-sale debt security as of December 31, 2021. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will\\nbe recognized on the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. No credit losses were recognized as of December 31, 2021 for the Company’s\\nmarketable and non-marketable debt securities.\\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position for which no allowance for credit losses was\\nrecorded, aggregated by major security type (in thousands):\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nEstimated Fair Value\\nUnrealized Losses\\nCertificates of deposit\\n$\\n506,161 \\n$\\n(283)\\nCorporate bonds\\n153,015 \\n(126)\\nCommercial paper\\n736,586 \\n(359)\\nU.S. government securities\\n31,717 \\n(28)\\nTotal available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position\\n$\\n1,427,479 \\n$\\n(796)\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n100\\nProperty and Equipment, net\\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\\nDecember 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\nBike fleet\\n$\\n138,216 \\n$\\n140,473 \\nLeasehold improvements\\n100,252 \\n105,169 \\nOwned vehicles\\n150,443 \\n112,498 \\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\n26,802 \\n28,109 \\nComputer equipment and software\\n19,103 \\n17,923 \\nFurniture and fixtures\\n5,110 \\n5,099 \\nConstruction in progress\\n25,270 \\n19,957 \\n465,196 \\n429,228 \\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\\n(167,001)\\n(115,931)\\nProperty and equipment, net\\n$\\n298,195 \\n$\\n313,297 \\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment was $115.3 million, $121.0 million, and $37.9 million for the years ended December 31,\\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\\nAccrued and Other Current Liabilities\\nAccrued and other current liabilities consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\\nDecember 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\nLegal accruals\\n$\\n349,518 \\n$\\n226,408 \\nInsurance-related accruals\\n336,340 \\n269,849 \\nRide-related accruals\\n196,716 \\n196,439 \\nLong-term debt, current\\n56,264 \\n35,760 \\nInsurance claims payable and related fees\\n33,696 \\n28,318 \\nOther\\n239,107 \\n197,234 \\nAccrued and other current liabilities\\n$\\n1,211,641 \\n$\\n954,008 \\nInsurance Reserves\\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the insurance reserve for the periods presented (in thousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nBalance at beginning of period\\n$\\n987,064 \\n$\\n1,378,462 \\n$\\n810,273 \\nReinsurance recoverable established in period\\n(251,328)\\n— \\n— \\nAdditions related to:\\nReserves for current period\\n276,810 \\n401,049 \\n889,653 \\nChange in estimates for prior periods\\n250,332 \\n168,131 \\n219,163 \\nLosses paid\\n(439,429)\\n(552,693)\\n(540,627)\\nTransfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities\\n— \\n(407,885)\\n— \\nNet balance at the end of the period\\n823,449 \\n987,064 \\n1,378,462 \\nAdd: Reinsurance recoverable at the end of the period\\n245,179 \\n— \\n— \\nBalance at end of period\\n$\\n1,068,628 \\n$\\n987,064 \\n$\\n1,378,462 \\nTransfer of Certain Legacy Auto Liability Insurance\\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, PVIC, entered into a Novation Agreement with Clarendon, and certain underwriting companies of\\nZurich. Pursuant to the terms of the Novation, on the effective date March 31, 2020, the\\n101\\nobligations of PVIC as reinsurer to Zurich for the Legacy Auto Liability, were assigned to, assumed by, and novated to Clarendon, for cash consideration of $465.0 million.\\nAs a result of the Novation, the Company’s obligations related to the Legacy Auto Liability were fully extinguished and novated to Clarendon on March 31, 2020.\\nThe  Company  paid  the  $465.0  million  cash  consideration  to  Clarendon  on  April  3,  2020.  The  Company  derecognized  $407.9  million  of  insurance  reserves\\nliabilities and recognized a loss of $64.7 million for the net cost of the Novation on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with\\n$62.5 million in cost of revenue and $2.2 million in general and administrative expenses. In conjunction with the Novation, Clarendon and PVIC executed a Retrocession\\nAgreement, pursuant to which PVIC will reinsure Clarendon’s losses related to the Legacy Auto Liability in excess of an aggregate limit of $816.0 million.\\nReinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liability Insurance\\nOn  April  22,  2021,  the  Company’s  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Pacific  Valley  Insurance  Company,  Inc.  (“PVIC”),  entered  into  a  Quota  Share  Reinsurance\\nAgreement (the “Reinsurance Agreement”) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (“DARAG”), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based\\non reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement,\\nPVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1,\\n2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (“the Reinsurance Transaction”). The Reinsurance Agreement is on a funds withheld\\nbasis, meaning that funds are withheld by PVIC from the insurance premium owed to DARAG in order to pay future reinsurance claims on DARAG’s behalf. Upon\\nconsummation of the Reinsurance Transaction, a reinsurance recoverable of $251.3 million was established, and since a contractual right of offset exists, the reinsurance\\nrecoverable has been netted against the funds withheld liability balance of $271.5 million for a $20.2 million net funds withheld liability balance included in accrued and\\nother current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the initial funds withheld balance of $271.5 million, additional coverage of certain legacy insurance\\nliabilities is collateralized by a trust account established by DARAG for the benefit of PVIC, which was $75.0 million upon consummation. As of December 31, 2021, the\\nbalance  of  the  net  funds  withheld  liability  is  zero.  A  loss  of  approximately  $20.4  million  for  the  total  cost  of  the  Reinsurance  Transaction  was  recognized  on  the\\nconsolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.\\nThe Reinsurance Transaction does not discharge PVIC of its obligations to the policyholder. Management evaluated reinsurance counterparty credit risk and does\\nnot consider it to be material since the premium of $271.5 million was retained by PVIC on a funds withheld basis on behalf of the reinsurer.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nThe following table sets forth the primary components of other income (expense), net as reported on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nInterest income\\n$\\n9,074 $\\n43,654 \\n$\\n102,506 \\nGain (loss) on sale of securities, net\\n687 \\n(868)\\n246 \\nForeign currency exchange gains (losses), net\\n788 \\n1,818 \\n(523)\\nSublease income\\n6,624 \\n— \\n— \\nGain from transaction with Woven Planet\\n119,284 \\n— \\n— \\nOther, net\\n(524)\\n(935)\\n366 \\nOther income (expense), net\\n$\\n135,933 $\\n43,669 \\n$\\n102,595 \\n_______________\\n(1)\\nInterest income was reported as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations in periods prior to the second quarter of 2020.\\n(1)\\n102\\n7.

However, these balances are included within the $1.2 billion of restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted short-term investments on the consolidated balance\\nsheets.\\nThe fair value of the Company’s Level 1 financial instruments is based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of the Company’s Level 2\\nfixed income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model driven\\nvaluations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other\\nestimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n103\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.\\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values and the carrying value of our non-\\nmarketable equity securities are remeasured to fair value based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred\\nto as the measurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of\\noperations.\\nIn March 2020, the Company purchased a non-marketable equity security for total cash consideration of $10.0 million that is classified in other investments on the\\nconsolidated balance sheets.\\nIn June 2021, the Company received an investment in a non-marketable equity security in a privately held company without a readily determinable market value\\nas part of licensing and data access agreements. The investment had a carrying value of $64.0 million and is categorized as Level 3. The Company does not have significant\\ninfluence over this privately-held company and has elected to measure this investment as a non-marketable equity security and classified it in other investments on the\\nconsolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, there were no remeasurement adjustments related to this non-marketable equity security.\\nAt  December  31,  2021,  there  were  $80.4  million  of  financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  non-recurring  basis  within  other  investments  on  the\\nconsolidated balance sheets.\\n8. Leases\\nReal Estate Operating Leases\\nThe Company leases real estate property at approximately 81 locations of which all leases have commenced as of December 31, 2021. These leases are classified\\nas operating leases. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining lease terms vary from one month to eight years. For certain leases the Company has options to extend the lease\\nterm for periods varying from two months to ten years. These renewal options are not considered in the remaining lease term unless it is reasonably certain that the\\nCompany will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representing\\nthe fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance or other services provided by the\\nlandlord, are accounted for as a component of the lease payment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.\\nFlexdrive Program\\nThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing companies. These leases are\\nclassified as finance leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining lease terms vary\\nbetween one month to three years. These leases generally do not contain any non-lease components and, as such, all payments due under these arrangements are allocated to\\nthe respective lease component.\\n104\\nLease Position as of December 31, 2021\\nThe table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands, except for remaining lease terms and\\npercentages):\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nDecember 31, 2020\\nOperating Leases\\nAssets\\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n223,412 \\n$\\n275,756 \\nLiabilities\\nOperating lease liabilities, current\\n$\\n53,765 \\n$\\n49,291 \\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current\\n210,232 \\n265,803 \\nTotal operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n263,997 \\n$\\n315,094 \\nFinance Leases\\nAssets\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n26,802 \\n$\\n28,108 \\nLiabilities\\nFinance lease liabilities, current\\n13,556 \\n20,795 \\nFinance lease liabilities, non-current\\n14,242 \\n6,593 \\nTotal finance lease liabilities\\n$\\n27,798 \\n$\\n27,388 \\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\\nOperating leases\\n5.6\\n6.3\\nFinance leases\\n2.2\\n1.5\\nWeighted-average discount rate\\nOperating leases\\n6.3 %\\n6.4 %\\nFinance leases\\n2.8 %\\n4.7 %\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nThis balance is included within property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets and was primarily related to leases acquired in the Flexdrive transaction.

Commitments and Contingencies\\nNoncancelable Purchase Commitments\\nIn March 2018, the Company entered into a noncancelable arrangement with AWS, a web-hosting services provider, under which the Company had an obligation\\nto purchase a minimum amount of services from this vendor through June 2021. In January 2019 and May 2020, the parties modified the aggregate commitment amounts\\nand  timing.  Under  the  amended  arrangement,  the  Company  committed  to  spend  an  aggregate  of  at  least  $300  million  between  January  2019  and  June  2022,  with  a\\nminimum amount of $80 million in each of the three contractual periods, on services with AWS. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has made payments in excess of\\n$300 million under the amended arrangement.\\nIn November 2018, the Company completed  the acquisition  of Motivate,  a New York headquartered  bikeshare  company. Over the approximately  five years\\nfollowing the transaction, the Company committed to invest an aggregate of $100 million in the bikeshare program for the New York metro area. The Company also\\nassumed  certain  pre-existing  contractual  obligations  to  increase  the  bike  fleets  in  other  locations  which  are  not  considered  to  be  material.  The  Company  has  made\\ninvestments totaling $87.1 million as of December 31, 2021.\\nIn May 2019, the Company entered into a noncancelable arrangement with the City of Chicago, with respect to the Divvy bike share program, under which the\\nCompany has an obligation to pay approximately $7.5 million per year to the City of Chicago through January 2028 and to spend a minimum of $50 million on capital\\nequipment  for  the  bike  share  program  through  January  2023.  The  Company  has  made  payments  totaling  $23.1  million  and  investments  totaling  $23.5  million  as  of\\nDecember 31, 2021.\\nAs of December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments under the Company’s noncancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in thousands):\\n2022\\n$\\n46,752 \\n2023\\n36,519 \\n2024\\n8,800 \\n2025\\n9,092 \\n2026\\n9,396 \\nThereafter\\n9,711 \\nTotal future minimum payments\\n$\\n120,270 \\nLetters of Credit\\nThe Company maintains certain stand-by letters of credit from third-party financial institutions in the ordinary course of business to guarantee certain performance\\nobligations related to leases, insurance policies and other various contractual arrangements.\\n107\\nThe outstanding letters of credit are collateralized by cash. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of $53.1 million and $54.2\\nmillion, respectively.\\nIndemnification\\nThe Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain business partners,\\ninvestors, contractors, parties to certain acquisition or divestiture transactions and the Company’s officers, directors and certain employees. The Company has agreed to\\nindemnify and defend the indemnified party’s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-party claims\\nbecause of the Company’s activities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine the\\nmaximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  the  Company’s  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  and\\ncircumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisions\\nhave not been material.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nThe Company is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations in the\\nordinary course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, or third parties (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage and\\nexpense related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company’s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicable\\nlaw,  or  that  the  Company  has  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  fees,  rules  or  policies,  as  well  as  proceedings  related  to  product  liability,  its  acquisitions,  securities\\nissuances or business practices, or public disclosures about the business. In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigation\\nmatters related to accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.\\nThe outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a material loss\\nis reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor is the Company able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could\\npotentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of the\\namount recorded.\\nIndependent Contractor Classification Matters\\nWith regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,\\nadministrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of these\\ndrivers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that would apply to driver\\nemployees.  Laws  and  regulations  that  govern  the  status  and  classification  of  independent  contractors  are  subject  to  change  and  divergent  interpretations  by  various\\nauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.\\nFor example, Assembly Bill 5 (as codified in part at Cal. Labor Code sec. 2750.3) codified and extended an employment classification test set forth by the\\nCalifornia Supreme Court that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional challenges to\\nthe independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of Los\\nAngeles,  San Diego  and San  Francisco  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Company  and  Uber  for  allegedly  misclassifying  drivers  on  the  companies’  respective  platforms  as\\nindependent  contractors  in  violation  of  Assembly  Bill  5  and  California’s  Unfair  Competition  Law,  and  on  August  5,  2020,  the  California  Labor  Commissioner  filed\\nlawsuits against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive relief\\nand material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers in\\nCalifornia as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework for\\ndrivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. On\\nApril 20, 2021, the court granted the parties’ joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 3, 2021, the California\\nLabor Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The coordination\\npetition was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in the\\nCalifornia Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Court\\ndenied review on February 3, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services\\n(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that successfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in the\\nAlameda lawsuit. On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable. Both the California\\nAttorney General and PADS have filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal. Briefing is currently underway. Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney\\nGeneral filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory and\\ninjunctive relief. The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021. In September 2021, the Massachusetts Attorney General\\nserved Lyft and Uber with a motion for summary judgment on the issue of\\n108\\ndriver classification. In January 2022, before Lyft and Uber served their opposition briefs, the court continued the summary judgment motion until at least June 2022 to\\nallow the parties more time to conduct discovery. Certain adverse outcomes of such actions would have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition\\nand  results  of  operations,  including  damages,  penalties  and  potential  suspension  of  operations  in  impacted  jurisdictions,  including  California  or  Massachusetts.  The\\nCompany’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Such regulatory scrutiny or action\\nmay create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another.\\nThe Company is currently involved in a number of putative class actions, thousands of individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\\npursuant to the Company\\'s Terms of Service to arbitration, matters brought, in whole or in part, as representative actions under California’s Private Attorney General Act,\\nLabor Code Section 2698, et seq., alleging that the Company misclassified drivers as independent contractors and other matters challenging the classification of drivers on\\nthe Company’s platform as independent contractors. The Company is currently defending allegations in a number of lawsuits that the Company has failed to properly\\nclassify drivers and provide those drivers with sick leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still\\nuncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nThe  Company  disputes  any  allegations  of  wrongdoing  and  intends  to  continue  to  defend  itself  vigorously  in  these  matters.  However,  results  of  litigation,\\narbitration and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these driver claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material\\nimpact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverse\\nimpact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.\\nUnemployment Insurance Assessment\\nThe Company is involved in administrative audits with various state employment agencies, including audits related to driver classification, in California, Oregon,\\nWisconsin,  Illinois,  New  York,  New  Jersey  and  North  Carolina.  The  Company  believes  that  drivers  are  properly  classified  as  independent  contractors  and  plans  to\\nvigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain. The Company accrues liabilities that may\\nresult from assessments by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and the expense is recorded\\nto general and administrative expenses.\\nIndirect Taxes\\nThe Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arises from\\ndisputes on tax treatment and tax rates applied to the sale of the Company’s services in these jurisdictions. The Company accrues indirect taxes that may result from\\nexaminations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general and\\nadministrative expenses.\\nPatent Litigation\\nThe Company is currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of\\nbusiness, the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or asserting\\ninfringement of such property. The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company’s chances of\\nsuccess on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nConsumer and Other Class Actions\\nThe Company is involved in a number of class actions alleging violations of consumer protection laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or\\nTCPA, as well as violations of other laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, seeking injunctive or other relief. Recently, the Company received a\\nfavorable outcome in a case in the Northern District of California alleging ADA violations with respect to Lyft’s wheelchair accessible vehicle offerings in three Bay Area\\ncounties, Independent Living Resource Center San Francisco (“ILRC”) v. Lyft, Inc. After hearing evidence at a 5-day bench trial, the court ruled that plaintiffs failed their\\nburden to prove that Lyft violates the ADA. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling. Lyft is facing a similar ADA lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, Lowell v.\\nLyft,  Inc.,  which  seeks  to  certify  New  York  and  nationwide  classes.  The  Company  disputes  any  allegations  of  wrongdoing  and  intends  to  continue  to  defend  itself\\nvigorously in these matters. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nPersonal Injury and Other Safety Matters\\nIn the ordinary course of the Company’s business, various parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that the Company is liable for\\ndamages related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders, or renters using or who have used services offered on the Lyft Platform, as well as from third\\nparties. The Company is currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers on the Lyft Platform, other riders,\\nrenters and third parties. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses, disputes the allegations of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in\\n109\\nthese matters. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company’s opinion, is likely to\\nhave  a  material  impact  on  its  business,  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations;  however,  results  of  litigation  and  claims  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  legal\\nproceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nFor example, on January 17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple plaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating to\\nalleged  sexual  assault  or  harassment  by  drivers  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  and  a  Judicial  Council  Coordinated  Proceeding  has  been  created  before  the  Superior  Court  of\\nCalifornia, County of San Francisco, where the claims of these and other plaintiffs are currently pending. Regardless of the outcome of these or other matters, litigation can\\nhave an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.\\nAlthough the Company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits, its chances of success on the merits are still uncertain as these matters are at various stages of\\nlitigation and present a wide range of potential outcomes. The Company accrues for losses that may result from these matters when a loss is probable and reasonably\\nestimable.\\nSecurities Litigation\\nBeginning in April 2019, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions have been filed in state and federal courts against the Company, its directors,\\ncertain of its officers, and certain of the underwriters named in the IPO Registration Statement alleging violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other\\ncauses of action in connection with the IPO. The putative class actions have been consolidated into two putative class actions, one in California state court and the other in\\nfederal court. The derivative actions have also been consolidated into one action in federal court in California. On July 1, 2020, the California state court sustained in part\\nand overruled in part the Company\\'s demurrer to the consolidated complaint. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on August 3, 2020. On February\\n26, 2021, the California state court struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend, and plaintiffs filed an amended\\ncomplaint on March 17, 2021. The Company filed its demurrer and motion to strike the amended claim on April 13, 2021, and on July 16, 2021, the California state court\\noverruled the demurrer but struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend. The state court plaintiffs filed their renewed\\nmotion to certify a class action on June 24, 2021, and on January 25, 2022, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion without prejudice and stayed the case in light of the certified\\nclass action proceeding in federal court. In the California federal court class action, on May 14, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint\\nand on September 8, 2020, the federal court granted in part and denied in part that motion. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on October 2, 2020,\\nand the court certified the class action on August 20, 2021, and set trial to commence on December 5, 2022. On February 8, 2022, the parties informed the court they had\\nreached an agreement in principle to settle the case on a class-wide basis. In the consolidated derivative action, at the parties’ joint request, the California federal court\\nstayed the case on February 17, 2021. Although the Company believes these lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them, the Company has\\naccrued amounts related to such matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general and administrative expenses.\\n10.

The 2025 Notes were offered and sold pursuant to a\\npurchase  agreement  (the  \"Purchase  Agreement\")  with  J.P.  Morgan  Securities  LLC  and  Credit  Suisse  Securities  (USA)  LLC,  as  representatives  of  the  several  initial\\npurchasers (the \"Initial Purchasers\") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\\n“Securities Act”).\\nThe 2025 Notes mature on May 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company\\nwith interest payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020, at a rate of 1.50% per year. The net proceeds\\nfrom this offering were approximately $733.2 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and debt issuance costs.\\nThe initial conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is 26.0491 shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, which is\\nequivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $38.39 per share of the Class A common stock. The initial conversion price of the 2025 Notes represents a\\npremium of approximately 30% to the $29.53 per share closing price of the Company\\'s Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2020. The\\nconversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.\\nThe 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15,\\n2025, only under the following circumstances:\\n•\\nduring any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock, for at least 20\\ntrading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately\\npreceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\\n•\\nduring the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the\\nIndenture) per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last\\nreported sale price of the Company\\'s Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\\n•\\nif the Company calls such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the\\nredemption date; or\\n•\\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\\nOn or after February 15, 2025, the 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day\\nimmediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares\\nof the Company\\'s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and\\nsubject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture.\\nHolders of the 2025 Notes who convert their 2025 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined\\nin the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamental\\nchange (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2025 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the\\nprincipal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\\nIn accounting for the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into a liability and an equity component. At the date of issuance, the\\nCompany determined the fair value of the liability component to be $558.3 million calculated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the borrowing rate for\\na similar nonconvertible debt instrument. The equity component representing the conversion option was $189.2 million and was determined by deducting the fair value of\\nthe  liability  component  from  the  par  value  of  the  2025  Notes.  The  equity  component  is  not  remeasured  as  long  as  it  continues  to  meet  the  conditions  for  equity\\nclassification. The difference between the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and the liability component (\"debt discount\") is amortized to interest expense over the\\ncontractual term at an effective interest rate of 8.0%.\\n111\\nDebt issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes totaled $14.3 million and was comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the Initial Purchasers and third-\\nparty offering costs. The Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the 2025 Notes based on their relative values. Issuance\\ncosts attributable to the liability component were $10.7 million and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term.\\nIssuance costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in stockholders’ equity.\\nThe last reported sale price of the Company\\'s Class A common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price of the 2025 Notes for at least 20 trading days during\\nthe 30 consecutive trading day period ended June 30, 2021. Accordingly, the 2025 Notes were convertible at the option of the holders at any time during the quarter ended\\nSeptember 30, 2021. During the quarter ended September 30, 2021, holders of $2,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes elected early conversion. The\\nCompany settled the conversion in cash resulting in an immaterial recognized loss on extinguishment of the liability and equity components during the third quarter of\\n2021.\\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the 2025 Notes did not meet any of the circumstances that would allow for a conversion.\\nBased on the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock on December 31, 2021, the if-converted value of the 2025 Notes was $832.0\\nmillion, exceeding the outstanding principal amount.\\nThe net carrying amounts of the liability component of the 2025 Notes were as follows (in thousands):\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nPrincipal\\n$\\n747,498 \\nUnamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs\\n(143,181)\\nNet carrying amount of liability component\\n$\\n604,317 \\nAs of December 31, 2021, the total estimated fair values (which represents a Level 2 valuation) of the 2025 Notes were approximately $1.0 billion. The estimated\\nfair value of the 2025 Notes was determined based on a market approach which was determined based on the actual bids and offers of the 2025 Notes in an over-the-counter\\nmarket on the last trading day of the period.\\nThe 2025 Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants, restrictions on dividends, incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or restrictions\\non the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company.\\n112\\nCapped Calls\\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with certain of the\\nInitial Purchasers or their respective affiliates (the \"option counterparties\") at a cost of approximately $132.7 million. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution\\nadjustments, the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the 2025 Notes sold in the offering. By entering into the Capped Calls, the Company expects to\\nreduce the potential dilution to its Class A common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2025 Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the\\nevent that at the time of conversion of the 2025 Notes the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2025 Notes. The\\ncap price of the Capped Calls will initially be $73.83 per share, which represents a premium of 150% over the last reported sale price of the Company\\'s Class A common\\nstock of $29.53 per share on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2020, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls.\\nThe Capped Calls meet the criteria for classification in equity, are not remeasured each reporting period and included as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital\\nwithin shareholders’ equity.\\nNon-revolving Loan\\nFollowing  the  acquisition  of  Flexdrive  by  the  Company  on  February  7,  2020,  Flexdrive  remained  responsible  for  its  obligations  under  a  Loan  and  Security\\nAgreement dated March 11, 2019, as amended (the “Non-revolving Loan”) with a third-party lender. Pursuant to the term of the Non-revolving Loan as amended on June\\n21, 2021, Flexdrive may request an extension of credit in the form of advances up to a maximum principal amount of $130 million to purchase new Hyundai and Kia\\nvehicles, or for other purposes, subject to approval by the lender. Advances paid or prepaid under the Non-revolving Loan may not be reborrowed. Repayment terms for\\neach advance include equal monthly installments sufficient to fully amortize the advances over the term, with an option for the final installment to be greater than the\\nothers. The repayment term for each advance ranges from 24 months to a maximum term of 48 months. Interest is payable monthly in arrears at a fixed interest rate equal to\\nthe one-month LIBOR plus a spread on the date of the loan which ranges from 2.51% for an advance with a 24 month term and 2.74% for an advance with a 48 month\\nterm. The Non-revolving Loan is secured by all vehicles financed under the Non-revolving Loan.\\nThe  Non-revolving  Loan  also  contains  customary  affirmative  and  negative  covenants  that,  among  other  things,  limit  Flexdrive’s  ability  to  enter  into  certain\\nacquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events with\\nrespect  to  Flexdrive  or  the  Company,  all  amounts  due  under  the  Non-revolving  Loan  may  become  immediately  due  and  payable,  among  other  remedies. As  of\\nDecember 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Non-revolving Loan. Further, the Company continued to guarantee the payments of\\nFlexdrive for any amounts borrowed following the acquisition.\\nMaster Vehicle Loan\\nFollowing  the  acquisition  of  Flexdrive  by  the  Company  on  February  7,  2020,  Flexdrive  remained  responsible  for  its  obligations  under  a  Master  Vehicle\\nAcquisition Financing and Security Agreement, dated February 7, 2020 as amended (the “Master Vehicle Loan”) with a third-party lender. Pursuant to the term of the\\nMaster Vehicle Loan, Flexdrive may request loans up to a maximum principal amount of $50 million to purchase vehicles. Repayment terms for each loan include equal\\nmonthly installments sufficient to amortize the loan over the term, with an option for the final installment to be greater than the others and is typically equal to the residual\\nvalue guarantee the Company provides to the lender. The repayment term for each loan ranges from a minimum term of 12 months to a maximum term of 48 months.\\nInterest is payable monthly in advance at a fixed interest rate equal to the three-year swap rate plus a spread of 2.10% on the date of the loan. Principal amounts outstanding\\nrelated to the Master Vehicle Loan may be fully or partially prepaid at the option of Flexdrive and must be prepaid under certain circumstances. However, if a loan is\\nterminated for any reason prior to the last day of the minimum loan term Flexdrive will be obligated to pay to the lender, an early termination fee in an amount which is\\nequal to the interest which would otherwise be payable by Flexdrive to lender for the remainder of the minimum loan term for that loan. The Master Vehicle Loan is\\nsecured by all vehicles financed under the Master Vehicle Loan as well as certain amounts held in escrow for the benefit of the lender. Amounts held in escrow are recorded\\nas restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nThe  Master  Vehicle  Loan  contains  customary  affirmative  and  negative  covenants  that,  among  other  things,  limit  Flexdrive’s  ability  to  enter  into  certain\\nacquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events with\\nrespect  to  Flexdrive  or  the  Company,  all  amounts  due  under  the  Master  Vehicle  Loan  may  become  immediately  due  and  payable,  among  other  remedies.  As  of\\nDecember  31, 2021,  Flexdrive  was in  compliance  with all  covenants  related  to  the  Master  Vehicle  Loan  in  all  material  respects.  Further,  the  Company continued  to\\nguarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed following the acquisition.\\nThe fair values of the Non-revolving Loan and Master Vehicle Loan were $75.4 million and $31.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and were\\ndetermined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which are considered a Level 2 valuation input.\\n113\\nMaturities of long-term debt outstanding, including current maturities, as of December 31, 2021 were as follows (in thousands):\\n2022\\n$\\n56,264 \\n2023\\n29,292 \\n2024\\n21,564 \\n2025\\n604,317 \\n2026\\n— \\nThereafter\\n— \\nTotal long-term debt outstanding\\n$\\n711,437 \\nVehicle Procurement Agreement\\nFollowing the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Vehicle Procurement\\nAgreement (“VPA”), as amended, with a third-party (“the Procurement Provider”). Procurement services under the VPA include purchasing and upfitting certain motor\\nvehicles as specified by Flexdrive, interim financing, providing certain fleet management services, including without limitation vehicle titling, registration and tracking\\nservices on behalf of Flexdrive. Pursuant to the terms of the VPA, Flexdrive will make the applicable payments to the Procurement Provider for the procurement services\\neither directly or through an advance made by the Master Vehicle Loan or the Non-revolving Loan. Interest on interim financing is payable on any unpaid amount based on\\neither the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least seven of the ten largest US banks or LIBOR of interest for one month periods as set forth in The Wall Street\\nJournal plus a spread of 3.00%, as applicable.\\nThe Procurement Provider has a security interest in vehicles purchased until the full specified payment has been indefeasibly paid. The VPA contains customary\\naffirmative and negative covenants restricting certain activities by Flexdrive. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the VPA. As\\nof December 31, 2021, the outstanding borrowings from the interim financing under the VPA was $14.9 million.\\nOn March 11, 2019, the Procurement Provider entered into a $95.0 million revolving credit facility with a third-party lender to finance the acquisition of motor\\nvehicles on behalf of Flexdrive under the VPA. On September 17, 2020, the revolving credit facility was amended, extending the stated maturity date to December 31, 2021\\nand reducing the borrowing capacity to $50.0 million. On March 11, 2019, Flexdrive entered into a Limited Non-Recourse Secured Continuing Guaranty and Subordination\\nAgreement  with  the  third-party  lender  to  guarantee  the  Procurement  Provider\\'s  performance  for  any  amount  borrowed  under  the  revolving  credit  facility.  As  of\\nDecember 31, 2021, there was no exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee.\\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings from any other financings.\\n11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\\nThe Company previously issued Series Seed, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, Series F, Series G, Series H, and Series I redeemable convertible\\npreferred stock prior to the IPO. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO on April 2, 2019, all outstanding shares of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred\\nstock converted into an aggregate of 219.2 million shares of Class A common stock with a carrying value of $5.2 million.\\nVoting\\nThe holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock had one vote for each share of common stock into which the shares of redeemable convertible preferred\\nstock would have been converted, subject to certain limitations.\\nDividends\\nThe holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock were entitled to receive noncumulative dividends, when, as and if declared by the board of directors, in\\nproportion to the original purchase price of such shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, no dividends have been declared or paid.\\nLiquidation Preference\\nIn  the  event  of  any  liquidation,  dissolution,  or  winding  up  of  the  Company,  either  voluntary  or  involuntary,  the  holders  of the  then  outstanding  redeemable\\nconvertible preferred stock, were entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the holders of the common stock, a\\nliquidation preference in an amount per share disclosed in the above table (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations) plus all declared but unpaid\\ndividends on such shares.\\n114\\nIf the Company did not have enough assets and funds legally available for distribution to meet this requirement, all of the Company’s assets and funds available\\nwere  to  be  distributed  ratably  among  the  holders  of  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  in  proportion  to  the  preferential  amount  per  share  each  such  holder  was\\notherwise entitled to receive.\\nUnless  stockholders  representing  (a)  a  majority  of  the  then-outstanding  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock,  voting  together  as  a  single  class  on  an  as-\\nconverted basis, (b) a majority of the Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock and Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, voting together as a single class\\non an as-converted basis, (c) a majority of the Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock, voting as a separate series, (d) a majority of the Series F redeemable\\nconvertible preferred stock, voting as a separate series, (e) a majority of the Series G redeemable convertible preferred stock, voting as a separate series, (f) a majority of the\\nSeries H redeemable convertible preferred stock, voting as a separate series (provided, however, that the approval of the holders of 71% of the Series H redeemable\\nconvertible preferred stock is required under certain circumstances) and (g) a majority of the Series I redeemable convertible preferred stock, voting as a separate series,\\nelect otherwise, a “Deemed Liquidation Event” is defined to include (i) any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, (ii) the merger or consolidation of the\\nCompany in which the holders of capital stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation do not continue to represent immediately\\nfollowing such merger or consolidation at least 50%, by voting power, of the outstanding capital stock of the resulting or surviving entity or (iii) a sale, lease, transfer or\\nother disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets or the grant of an exclusive license to all or substantially all of the Company’s intellectual property\\n(other than to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company). The Company previously classified its redeemable convertible preferred stock outside of stockholders’ equity\\n(deficit) because the shares contain liquidation features that are not solely within the Company’s control.\\nConversion\\nEach share of redeemable convertible preferred stock was convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock as determined by dividing its original price\\nper share by the conversion price in effect at the time of conversion. The initial conversion price per share of each series of redeemable convertible preferred stock was\\nequal to its respective original price per share, as indicated in the table above. The initial conversion price per share for each series of redeemable convertible preferred\\nstock was subject to adjustment in accordance with anti-dilution provisions contained in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO on April 2, 2019, all outstanding shares of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into\\nan aggregate of 219.2 million shares of Class A common stock.\\nRedemption\\nNo shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were unilaterally redeemable by either the stockholders or the Company; however, the Company’s Amended\\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation provided that upon any liquidation event such shares were entitled to receive the applicable liquidation preference.\\n12. Common Stock and Employee Stock Plans\\nCommon Stock\\nThe Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The rights of the\\nholders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to\\none vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 20 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of\\nshares of Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of Class A common stock upon transfer. Any dividends paid to the holders of Class A common stock and\\nClass B common stock will be paid on a pro rata basis. On a liquidation event, any distribution to common stockholders is made on a pro rata basis to the holders of the\\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock.\\n115\\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s shares of common stock reserved for issuance as of December 31, 2021:\\nOptions issued and outstanding under the 2008 Plan\\n1,104,813 \\nRSUs outstanding under the 2008 Plan, the 2018 Plan, and the 2019 Plan\\n17,115,723 \\nRemaining shares available for future issuance under the 2019 ESPP Plan and the 2019 Plan\\n82,426,987 \\nEquity Award Plans\\n2008 Equity Incentive Plan\\nIn July 2008, the board of directors of the Company adopted the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan) under which the Company may grant options to\\npurchase its common stock and offer to sell and issue restricted shares of its common stock and issue RSUs to selected employees, officers, directors and consultants of the\\nCompany. In June 2018, this plan was superseded by the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan) and all reserved shares under the 2008 Plan were transferred to the\\n2018 Plan.\\nUnder the 2008 Plan, incentive stock options and nonqualified  stock options are to be granted at a price that is not less than 100% of the fair  value of the\\nunderlying common stock at the date of grant; provided, that incentive stock options granted to a person who directly or by attribution owns more than ten percent (10%) of\\nthe total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company are to be at a price not less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the fair value of the underlying\\ncommon stock at the date of grant.

The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining\\nweighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years. The Company recognizes compensation expense on the RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of its IPO Registration\\nStatement on March 28, 2019 using the accelerated attribution method. All RSUs granted after March 28, 2019 vest on the satisfaction of a service-based condition only.\\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for such RSUs upon a straight-line basis over their requisite service periods.\\n13.

The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of\\nthe deferred tax assets such that a valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include the Company’s history of net losses since its inception.\\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively.\\nThe federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates beginning in 2030 and will continue to expire through\\n2037, while federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 or later do not expire. The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2022 and will\\ncontinue to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations\\ndue to the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions.\\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment for\\nU.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2021.\\nThe Company has not provided foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,\\nbecause it intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will be\\nimmaterial, due to the participation exemption put in place by the 2017 Tax Act.\\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest\\nand penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in its\\nconsolidated statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. The Company has no material unrecognized tax benefits as of\\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\\n120\\n14. Net Loss Per Share\\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares\\nsubject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For\\npurposes of this calculation, redeemable convertible preferred stock, stock options, RSUs, PSUs, the 2025 Notes, restricted stock awards, stock purchase rights granted\\nunder the Company’s ESPP and early exercised stock options are considered to be common stock equivalents but are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per\\nshare when including them has an anti-dilutive effect. Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same\\nliquidation and dividend rights.\\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nNet loss\\n$\\n(1,009,359)\\n$\\n(1,752,857)\\n$\\n(2,602,241)\\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share, basic and diluted\\n334,724 \\n312,175 \\n227,498 \\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted\\n$\\n(3.02)\\n$\\n(5.61)\\n$\\n(11.44)\\nThe following potentially dilutive outstanding shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because including\\nthem would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied by the end of the\\nperiod (in thousands):\\nAs of December 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2025 Notes\\n19,471 \\n19,471 \\n— \\nRestricted stock units\\n16,285 \\n33,428 \\n41,685 \\nStock options\\n1,105 \\n1,919 \\n2,957 \\nPerformance based restricted stock units\\n831 \\n175 \\n— \\nESPP\\n115 \\n89 \\n— \\nRestricted stock awards\\n— \\n— \\n94 \\nTotal\\n37,807 \\n55,082 \\n44,736 \\n_______________\\n(1)\\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into Capped Calls, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, as\\ntheir effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Capped Calls are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the Company\\'s common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2025 Notes is\\nsettled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2025 Notes the Company\\'s common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2025\\nNotes.\\n15. Related Party Transactions\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company purchased certain advertising-related and other services in the amount of $18.1 million from a company\\nthat is affiliated with a significant stockholder of the Company, which was recorded to cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of\\noperations based on the nature of the services. This entity ceased to be a related party in April 2019.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company purchased certain marketing services in the amount of $1.9 million from two companies owned by a\\nsignificant  stockholder  of  the  Company.  During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  amounts  purchased  from  these  related  parties  as  included  on  the\\nconsolidated statement of operations were immaterial.\\nAs of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, amounts due from and to these related parties as included on the consolidated balance sheets were immaterial.\\nThe Company\\'s remaining transactions with related parties were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\\n16. 401(k) Plan\\nThe Company adopted a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the IRC. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating employees\\nmay defer a portion of their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company does not make contributions for eligible employees.\\n(1)\\n121\\n17. Restructuring\\nApril 2020 Restructuring Plan\\nIn April 2020, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges\\nresulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Company’s business. As a result of the restructuring plan, which was substantially completed in the second\\nquarter of 2020, the Company recognized a stock-based compensation benefit related to the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expenses for\\nunvested stock awards, primarily related to RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of its IPO Registration Statement on March 28, 2019 using the accelerated attribution\\nmethod, of $72.7 million. This was offset by a $22.9 million charge related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards for employees who were terminated, resulting\\nin a net stock-based compensation benefit of $49.8 million. Additionally, the Company recognized other restructuring charges including severance and other employee\\ncosts of $32.1 million as well as lease termination and other restructuring charges of $3.1 million. As a result of the above, the Company recognized a net restructuring\\nbenefit of $14.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\\nThe following table summarizes the above restructuring related charges (benefits) by line item within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations where\\nthey were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nBenefit\\nSeverance and Other\\nEmployee Costs\\nLease Termination and\\nOther Costs\\nTotal\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n(4,237)\\n$\\n2,010 \\n$\\n1,529 \\n$\\n(698)\\nOperation and support\\n(2,830)\\n8,281 \\n1,060 \\n6,511 \\nResearch and development\\n(37,082)\\n11,706 \\n— \\n(25,376)\\nSales and marketing\\n(1,626)\\n3,071 \\n— \\n1,445 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n(4,031)\\n7,062 \\n539 \\n3,570 \\nTotal\\n$\\n(49,806)\\n$\\n32,130 \\n$\\n3,128 \\n$\\n(14,548)\\nNovember 2020 Restructuring Plan\\nIn November 2020, the Company announced an additional restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic\\nchallenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Company’s business. As a result of the restructuring plan, which was substantially completed in\\nthe fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a severance and other employee costs of $1.5 million. This was offset by a stock based compensation benefit of\\n$0.1 million due to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards for employees who were terminated. As a result, the Company recognized net restructuring costs of\\n$1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were no restructuring-related liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining liability for restructuring related costs was\\nimmaterial.\\n \\n122\\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\\nNone.\\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period\\ncovered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December\\n31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)\\nunder the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting\\nand the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\\nOur management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\\nOrganizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of\\nDecember 31, 2021.\\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the\\nExchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\\nreporting.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits\\nof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that\\nall control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that\\nbreakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more\\npeople or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,\\nand there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate\\nbecause of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,\\nmisstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\\nItem 9B. Other Information.\\nNone.\\nItem 9C.

Purpose of Agreement. I understand that the Company is engaged in a continuous program of research, development,\\nproduction  and  marketing  in  connection  with  its  business  and  that  it  is  critical  for  the  Company  to  preserve  and  protect  its\\n\"Confidential Information\" (as defined in Section 8 below), its rights in \"Inventions\" (as defined in Section 3 below) and in all\\nrelated  intellectual  property  rights.  Accordingly,  I  am  entering  into  this  Employee  Invention  Assignment  and  Confidentiality\\nAgreement (this \"Agreement\") as a condition of my employment with the Company, whether or not I am expected to create\\ninventions of value for the Company.\\n2. Inventions Retained and Licensed. I have attached hereto, as Exhibit A, a list describing all inventions, original\\nworks of authorship, developments, improvements, and trade secrets which were made by me prior to my employment with the\\nCompany (collectively, \"Prior Inventions\"), which belong to me, which relate to the Company\\'s proposed business, products or\\nresearch and development, and which are not assigned to the Company hereunder; or, if no such list is attached, I represent that\\nthere  are  no  such  Prior  Inventions.  If  in  the  course  of  my  employment  with  the  Company,  I  incorporate,  or  permit  to  be\\nincorporated, into a Company product, process or service a Prior Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest, I hereby\\ngrant to the Company a nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to make, have made,\\nmodify, use and sell such Prior Invention as part of or in connection with such product, process or service, and to practice any\\nmethod related thereto.\\n3. Disclosure  of  Inventions. I  will  promptly  disclose  in  confidence  to  the  Company  all  inventions,  improvements,\\ndesigns, original works of authorship, formulas, processes, computer software programs, databases, and trade secrets that I make\\nor conceive or first reduce to practice or create, either alone or jointly with others, during the period of my employment, in the\\ncourse of my employment, and whether or not patentable, copyrightable or protectable as trade secrets (the \"Inventions\").\\n4. Work for Hire; Assignment of Inventions. I acknowledge and agree that any copyrightable works prepared by me\\nwithin the scope of my employment are \"works for hire\" under the Copyright Act and other applicable law and that the Company\\nwill be considered the author and owner of such copyrightable works. I agree that all Inventions that (i) are developed using\\nequipment, supplies, facilities or trade secrets of the Company, (ii) result from work performed by me for the Company, or (iii)\\nrelate to the Company\\'s business or actual or demonstrably anticipated research and development (the \"Assigned Inventions\"), are\\nthe sole and exclusive property of the Company. I do hereby assign, the Assigned Inventions to the Company.\\n5. Labor Code Section 2870 Notice. This is notice required by the states of California, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, and\\nWashington, and any other such state requiring such notice, notifying employees in such states that they are not obligated to assign\\nto the Company any\\nrights  in  any  invention  that  the  employee  developed  entirely  on  his  or  her  own  time  without  using  the  Company\\'s\\nequipment,  supplies,  facilities,  material  or  trade  secret  information  unless  those  inventions  either  (1)  relate  to  the\\nCompany\\'s  business  or  actual  or  demonstrably  anticipated  research  or  development  of  the  Company  at  the  time  the\\ninvention was made, or (2) result from any work performed by the employee for the Company. Specifically, I have been\\nnotified and understand that the provisions of Sections 4 and 6 of this Agreement do not apply to any Assi ed Invention\\nthat qualifies fully under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code and similar laws. Section 2870\\nstates as follows:\\nANY  PROVISION  IN  AN  EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT  WHICH  PROVIDES  THAT  AN  EMPLOYEE\\nSHALL ASSIGN, OR OFFER TO ASSIGN, ANY OF HIS OR HER RIGHTS IN AN INVENTION TO HIS OR\\nHER  EMPLOYER  SHALL  NOT  APPLY  TO  AN  INVENTION  THAT  THE  EMPLOYEE  DEVELOPED\\nENTIRELY  ON  HIS  OR  HER  OWN  TIME  WITHOUT  USING  THE  EMPLOYER\\'S  EQUIPMENT,\\nSUPPLIES,  FACILITIES,  OR  TRADE  SECRET  INFORMATION  EXCEPT  FOR  THOSE  INVENTIONS\\nTHAT  EITHER:  (I)  RELATE  AT  THE  TIME  OF  CONCEPTION  OR  REDUCTION  TO  PRACTICE  OF\\nTHE  INVENTION  TO  THE  EMPLOYER\\'S  BUSINESS,  OR  ACTUAL  OR  DEMONSTRABLY\\nANTICIPATED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMPLOYER; OR (2) RESULT FROM ANY\\nWORK PERFORMED BY THE EMPLOYEE FOR THE EMPLOYER. TO THE EXTENT A PROVISION IN\\nAN  EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT  PURPORTS  TO  REQUIRE  AN  EMPLOYEE  TO  ASSIGN  AN\\nINVENTION  OTHERWISE  EXCLUDED  FROM  BEING  REQUIRED  TO  BE  ASSIGNED  UNDER\\nCALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION 2870(a), THE PROVISION IS AGAINST THE PUBLIC POLICY\\nOF THIS STATE AND IS UNENFORCEABLE.\\n1. Assignment of Other Rights. In addition to the foregoing assignment of Assigned Inventions to the Company, I\\ndo hereby irrevocably transfer and assi , to the Company: (i) all worldwide patents, patent applications, copyrights, mask\\nworks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, including but not limited to rights in databases, in any Assigned\\nInventions, along with any registrations of or applications to register such rights; and (ii) any and all \"Moral Rights\" (as\\ndefined below) that I may have in or with respect to any Assi ed Inventions. I also hereby forever waive and agree never\\nto assert any and all Moral Rights I may have in or with respect to any Assi ed Inventions, even after termination of my\\nwork  on  behalf  of  the  Company. \"Moral Rights\" mean  any  rights  to  claim  authorship  of  or  credit  on  an  Assigned\\nInventions,  to  object  to  or  prevent  the  modification  or  destruction  of  any  Assi ed  Inventions,  or  to  withdraw  from\\ncirculation  or  control  the  publication  or  distribution  of  any  Assi ed  Inventions,  and  any  similar  right,  existing  under\\njudicial or statutory law of any country or subdivision thereof in the world, or under any treaty, regardless of whether or\\nnot such right is denominated or generally referred to as a \"moral right.\"\\n2. Assistance. I agree to assist the Company in every proper way to obtain for the Company and enforce patents,\\ncopyrights, mask work rights, trade secret rights and other legal protections for the Company\\'s Assigned Inventions in any\\nand all countries. I will execute any documents that the Company may reasonably request for use in obtaining or enforcing\\nsuch patents, copyrights, mask work rights, trade secrets and other legal protections. My obligations\\ngn\\ngn\\ngn\\ngn\\ngn\\ngn\\nunder  this  paragraph  will  continue  beyond  the  termination  of  my  employment  with  the  Company,  provided  that  the\\nCompany will compensate me at a reasonable rate after such termination for time or expenses actually spent by me at the\\nCompany\\'s  request  on  such  assistance.  I  appoint  the  Secretary  of  the  Company  as  my  attorney-in-fact  to  execute\\ndocuments on my behalf for this purpose.\\n8. Confidential Information. I understand that during my employment by the Company I will receive access to\\nnon-public information of a confidential or secret nature that relates to the business of the Company or to the business of\\nany parent, subsidiary, affiliate, customer or supplier of the Company or any other party with whom the Company agrees\\nto  hold  information  of  such  party  in  confidence,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Assigned  Inventions,  trade  secrets,\\nmarketing plans, market studies, product plans, business strategies, financial information, forecasts, personnel information,\\ncustomer lists and data, domain names, information pertaining to the Company\\'s methods of operation, business plans, and\\nfinancial, business or technical information (the \"Confidential Information\"). I understand that Confidential Information\\ndoes  not  include  information  regarding  my  own  pay  and  benefits,  information  as  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of\\nemployment, or information that is deemed not confidential under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, and that\\nnothing  in  this  Agreement  will  be  construed  as  restricting  my  right  to  engage  in  legally  protected  activities  under\\napplicable law, including participating in lawful government investigations.\\n9. Confidentiality. I agree that my employment by the Company creates a relationship of confidence and trust with\\nrespect to any Confidential Information that may be disclosed to me by the Company or a third party in connection with\\nmy employment by the Company. Accordingly, at all times, both during my employment and after its termination, I will\\nkeep and hold all such Confidential Information in strict confidence and trust until such Confidential Information becomes\\npublicly and widely known and made generally available through no wrongful act of mine. I will not use or disclose any\\nConfidential Information without the prior written consent of the Company until such Confidential Information becomes\\npublicly and widely known and made generally available through no wrongful act of mine, except as may be necessary to\\nperform my duties as an employee of the Company for the benefit of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I\\nunderstand that this Agreement does not prevent me from revealing evidence of criminal wrongdoing or other violations of\\nthe  law  to  law  enforcement  or  any  government  agency,  from  divulging  Confidential  Information  by  order  of  court  or\\nagency of competent jurisdiction, or from making other disclosures that are protected under the provisions of applicable\\nlaw or regulation.\\n10.\\nReturn  of  Company  Property. Upon  termination  of  my  employment  with  the  Company,  I  will\\nimmediately deliver to the Company all documents and materials of any nature pertaining to my work with the Company\\nand all copies thereof in my possession, custody, or control, in all formats (whether tangible, electronic, or otherwise),\\nand, upon Company request, I will execute a document confirming my agreement to honor my responsibilities contained\\nin this Agreement. I will not take with me or retain any Company property,  including any documents or materials or\\ncopies thereof containing any Confidential  Information. Without limiting the  foregoing,  I  further  agree to provide the\\nCompany with access to any of my personal electronic devices, including computers and computer equipment, mobile\\ndevices, external storage devices, smart phones, tablets, and USB devices, that contain any Confidential Information or\\nother\\nCompany property in order to allow the Company to remove said property at time of termination. I agree that it is my\\nexpress obligation to provide the Company with access to such personal electronic devices at my exit interview or before\\nmy last date of employment to accomplish the same.\\n11.\\nNo Breach of Prior Agreement. I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement and\\nmy  duties  as  an  employee  of  the  Company  will  not  breach  any  invention  assignment,  proprietary  information,\\nconfidentiality or similar agreement with any former employer or other party. I represent that I will not bring with me to\\nthe Company or use in the performance of my duties for the Company any documents or materials or intangibles of a\\nformer employer or third party that are not generally available to the public or have not been legally transferred to the\\nCompany.\\n12.\\nEfforts; Duty of Loyalty. I understand that my employment with the Company requires my undivided\\nattention and effort. As a result, during my employment, I will not, without the company\\'s express written consent, engage\\nin any other employment or business that (i) directly competes with the current or future business of the Company; (ii)\\nuses any Company information, equipment, supplies, facilities or materials; or (iii) otherwise conflicts with the Company\\'s\\nbusiness interest and causes a disruption of its operations.\\n13.\\nNon-Solicitation  of  Employees/Consultants. During  my  employment  with  the  Company  and  for  a\\nperiod of one (1) year thereafter, I will not directly or indirectly solicit away employees or consultants of the Company for\\nmy own benefit or for the benefit of any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the above, this provision is not intended\\nto restrict communications addressed to the general public, such as advertising to fill open positions. Additionally, the post\\ntermination restriction applies to employees who were employed during my employment with the Company.\\n14.\\nNon-Solicitation of Customers/Suppliers. During my employment with the Company and for a period\\nof one (1) year thereafter, I will not directly or indirectly solicit or otherwise take away customers or suppliers of the\\nCompany  if,  in  so  doing,  I  use  or  disclose  any  trade  secrets  of  the  Company.  I  agree  that  the  non-public  names  and\\naddresses of the Company\\'s customers and suppliers, and all other confidential information related to them, including their\\nbuying and selling habits and special needs, created or obtained by me during my employment, constitute trade secrets or\\nconfidential information.\\n15.\\nNotification. I  hereby  authorize  the  Company  to  notify  third  parties,  including,  without  limitation,\\ncustomers and actual or potential employers, of the terms of this Agreement and my responsibilities hereunder, as well as\\nany alleged breaches under the Agreement.\\n16.\\nObligation to Supply Information and Notify Third Parties To Ensure Protection of Company\\'s\\nConfidential Information. In order to protect the Company\\'s trade secrets and confidential information from improper\\nuse  and  disclosure,  I  agree  to  certain  notification  procedures.  I  shall  notify  my  future  employers  of  the  terms  of  this\\nAgreement and my responsibilities contained therein for a period of two years after my employment with the Company is\\nterminated for any reason, as specified below. I agree that, prior to the commencement of any new employment, I shall: 1)\\nprovide the Company with the name and address of my new employer;\\n2) provide the Company with a general and public job description of my duties for the new employer; and 3) furnish my new\\nemployer with a copy of this Agreement.\\n17.\\nCertification and Exit Interview Requirement. I agree that upon the Company\\'s request at any time\\nduring my employment and for at least two years after my termination, I shall certify my compliance with this Agreement,\\nby submitting to the Company, a statement under penalty of perjury, stating that I have fully complied and continue to\\ncomply with the restrictions contained in Agreement as applicable upon written request within 10 business days of such\\nrequest.  I  also  agree  to  make  myself  available  for  an  exit  interview  with  Company  representative  at  the  time  of  my\\ndeparture from the Company.\\n18.\\nName & Likeness Rights. I hereby authorize the Company to use, reuse, and to grant others the right to\\nuse  and  reuse,  my  name,  photograph,  likeness  (including  caricature),  voice,  and  biographical  information,  and  any\\nreproduction or simulation thereof, in any form of media or technology now known or hereafter developed (including, but\\nnot limited to, film, video and digital or other electronic media), both during and after my employment, for any purposes\\nrelated to the Company\\'s business, such as marketing, advertising, credits, and presentations.\\n19.\\nInjunctive Relief. I understand that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by\\nme the Company may suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement.\\n20.\\nGoverning Law; Severability. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with\\nthe laws of the state in which I resided at the time I executed this Agreement, without giving effect to its laws pertaining to\\nconflict of laws. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be\\ninvalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible given the\\nintent of the parties hereto. If such clause or provision cannot be so enforced, such provision shall be stricken from this\\nAgreement and the remainder of this Agreement shall be enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable clause or\\nprovision had (to the extent not enforceable) never been contained in this Agreement.\\n21.\\nCounterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so\\nexecuted and delivered will be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.\\n22.\\nEntire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein constitute the entire agreement\\nand  understanding  of  the  parties  with  respect  to  the  subject  matter  of  this  Agreement,  and  supersede  all  prior\\nunderstandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between or among the parties hereto with respect to the specific\\nsubject matter hereof.\\n23.\\nAmendment and Waivers.

No waiver granted under this Agreement as to any one provision\\nherein shall constitute a subsequent waiver of such provision or of any other provision herein, nor shall it constitute the\\nwaiver of any performance other than the actual performance specifically waived.\\n24.\\nSuccessors and Assigns; Assignment. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement,\\nand the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of their respective\\nsuccessors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.

I agree and intend to create a direct, consequential benefit to all such entities.\\n26.\\nNon-Impairment  of  Statutory  and  Common  Law.

For purposes of this Mutual\\nArbitration Agreement (the \"Arbitration Agreement\"), references to Lyft shall include Lyft, Inc., and/or any entity affiliated with or related to Lyft,\\nInc. (including their owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, and all\\nsuccessors and assigns of any of them). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after the Agreement\\nterminates or my relationship with Lyft ends. Any arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class\\narbitrations and class actions are not permitted. Lyft and I further expressly waive the right to a jury trial, and Lyft and I agree that the\\narbitrator\\'s award will be final and binding on both parties.\\nThis Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. The types of disputes and claims covered by this Arbitration Agreement (referred\\nto below as \"Claims\") include, but are not limited to disputes over rights provided by federal, state, or local statutes, regulations, ordinances, and\\ncommon  law;  claims  related  to  salary,  overtime,  bonuses,  vacation,  paid  time  off,  wages,  meal  and  rest  breaks,  and  any  other  form  of\\ncompensation;  claims  for  breach  of  contract,  wrongful  discharge,  fraud,  defamation,  emotional distress,  retaliation  and  breach  of  the  implied\\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing; and claims involving laws that prohibit discrimination and unlawful harassment based on any protected\\nclassification, including claims under Title Vll of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in\\nEmployment  Act,  the  Older  Workers  Benefit  Protection  Act,  and  any  state  employment  statutes,  such  as  the  California  Fair  Employment  &\\nHousing Act, and the California Labor Code.\\n2.\\nDisputes Excluded From Arbitration\\nThis  Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  cover  claims  for  disability  and  medical  benefits  under  workers\\'  compensation  laws  or  claims  for\\nunemployment benefits. Likewise, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prohibits me from filing an administrative charge with the federal Equal\\nEmployment Opportunity Commission,\\nU.S.  Department  of  Labor,  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  National  Labor  Relations  Board,  the  Office  of  Federal  Contract  Compliance\\nPrograms, the California Department of Fair Employment & Housing, or any other similar local, state, or federal agency, or from participating in\\nany administrative agency investigation. Notwithstanding this Arbitration Provision, either Lyft or I may seek to obtain injunctive relief in court to\\navoid irreparable harm that might take place prior to the resolution of any arbitration.\\n3.\\nClass Action/Collective Action Waiver\\nLyft and I agree to bring any Claims in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis. Accordingly, neither I\\nnor Lyft shall bring, nor shall the arbitrator preside over, any form of class or collective proceeding. In addition, unless all parties agree in\\nwriting otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of more than one employee. Neither I nor Lyft may seek, nor\\nmay the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other employees.\\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this section\\nmay be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If a court decides that applicable law does not permit the\\nenforcement of any of this section\\'s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the\\narbitration and may be brought in court.\\n4.\\nRepresentative PAGA Waiver\\nTo  the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  law,  Lyft  and  I  (1) agree  not  to  bring  a  representative  action  on  behalf  of  others  under  the  Private\\nAttorneys General Act of 2004 (\"PAGA\"), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in\\nany court or in arbitration, and (2) agree that for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, any\\nsuch dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether I have personally been aggrieved or\\nsubject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective\\nproceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, \"representative PAGA\\nWaiver\"). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of\\nthis representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\\nIf any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall\\nbe  severed  from  this  Arbitration  Provision; (ii)  severance  of  the  unenforceable  provision  shall  have  no  impact  whatsoever  on  the  Arbitration\\nAgreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Provision; and (iii) any\\nsuch representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction\\nand not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the\\nrepresentative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending\\nthe outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.\\n5.\\nThe Arbitration Process\\nLyft and I agree that any dispute shall be addressed in the following manner: first, through good-faith negotiation between Lyft and me; second,\\nthrough a voluntary mediation paid for by Lyft, if both parties agree to mediation, administered by a mediator approved by Lyft and me; and third,\\nif still not resolved, by final, binding and confidential arbitration. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association\\n(\"AAA\") pursuant to its Employment Arbitration Rules & Mediation Procedures then in effect. I understand that copies of these rules are available\\nto me at https://www.adr.org and that Lyft will provide me with copies upon my request. I acknowledge that I had a full and fair opportunity to\\nread and review these rules to the extent that I wished before accepting this Arbitration Agreement.\\nLyft and I agree that the procedures outlined in this Arbitration Agreement will be the exclusive means of resolution for any Claims covered by this\\nArbitration Agreement, whether such disputes are initiated by Lyft or byme.\\nLyft and I agree that the arbitration will take place in (1) San Francisco, California, (2) ifl elect, in the county in which I was employed with the\\ncompany at the time that the dispute arose, or (3) at another location agreed to by the parties or if the parties cannot agree, at a location designated\\nby the arbitrator as a location convenient to both parties.\\nAs part of the arbitration, both Lyft and I will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the\\nClaim. The arbitrator, in his or her sole discretion, may permit any discovery necessary to allow either party to have a fair opportunity to pursue that\\nparty\\'s claims and defenses.\\n6.\\nPaying For The Arbitration\\nThe AAA\\'s rules will govern the amount and allocation of fees for the arbitration, subject to the provisions of this section. Lyft will pay any costs\\nthat are unique to the arbitration process, including fees for the arbitrator\\'s time and use of an arbitration forum. I will pay any costs that I am\\nrequired to pay under the AAA rules that would be imposed on me in a judicial forum, but in no event shall the AAA filing fee that I am\\nresponsible for paying exceed the filing fees that I would have paid if I had filed a complaint in a court of law having jurisdiction. I understand\\nthat I will be responsible for retaining my own attorney.\\n7.\\nThe Arbitration Award\\nThe arbitrator shall have authority to award monetary damages and any and all other individualized remedies that would be available in court,\\nand the arbitrator\\'s decision of whether or not to award such damages and\\nremedies shall be based on the statute or common law upon which the arbitrated claim(s) is/are based. The arbitrator shall have authority to\\naward to the prevailing party reasonable costs and attorneys\\' fees incurred in either bringing or defending an action under this Agreement, to the\\nextent such costs or fees would be recoverable under the law or statute giving rise to the claim(s) arbitrated.\\nThe arbitrator will issue a written decision that memorializes the essential findings of fact and law and the conclusions upon which the\\narbitrator\\'s decision and the award, if any, are based.\\n8.\\nThe Arbitration Initiation Procedure\\nTo facilitate good-faith negotiations, I agree to send written notice to arbitrationnotice@lyft.com stating the nature of my claim in sufficient detail\\nto advise Lyft of the nature of the dispute and the reliefl request. I agree that I will provide Lyft with that notice at least 45 days before initiating\\nany arbitration under this Arbitration Provision. Lyft agrees to do the same if it initiates any claim against me. I understand that the notice will be\\nused to investigate the claim, so that Lyft and I can engage in good-faith negotiations to resolve it promptly.\\n9.\\nThe Arbitration Agreement Opt-Out Procedure\\nI acknowledge that I have the opportunity to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. To do so, I must provide notice in writing to Lyft\\'s Legal\\nDepartment (by email to arbitrationnotice@lyft.com or by postal mail to Legal Department, Attn: Employment Counsel; Lyft, Inc.; 185 Berry\\nStreet; Suite 5000, San Francisco, CA 94107) specifically stating that I do not wish to be bound by this Arbitration Agreement. I understand that\\nsuch notice must be e-mailed or postmarked within thirty days (30 days) of my receipt of this Agreement in order to opt out. I understand that I\\nwill not be penalized in any manner for opting out of the Agreement.\\n10.\\nEnforcement Of The Arbitration Agreement\\nThis Arbitration Agreement is the full and complete agreement relating to the resolution of disputes between Lyft and me. In the event any\\nportion of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable except as otherwise\\nprovided above.\\n******************************************************************************************\\n*******************\\nMy signature below indicates that I understand and agree to be legally bound by this Mutual Arbitration Agreement, including its\\nwaiver of jury trials and class, representative, and private attorney general\\nactions.\\nT.

The Company intends for all benefits under this letter to comply with or be exempt from\\nthe requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any guidance promulgated thereunder\\n(“Section 409A”) so that you will not be subject to an additional tax under Section 409A on any payments or benefits under this\\noffer letter, and any ambiguities or ambiguous terms herein will be interpreted to so comply or be exempt. In no event will you\\nhave  discretion  to  determine  the  taxable  year  in  which  you  receive  any  vesting  benefits  or  expense  reimbursements.\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, provision of all or a portion of the benefits will be delayed until the date that is six (6) months and\\none (1) day following your termination of employment if and to the extent necessary to avoid subjecting you to an additional tax\\nunder Section 409A on any such benefits. Each benefit payable under this letter is intended to constitute a separate payment for\\npurposes of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations. Any benefit payable upon a termination of employment will, to\\nthe extent necessary to avoid the imposition of a tax on you under Section 409A, not be paid or otherwise\\n-5-\\nprovided until you have a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A. You and the Company agree to work\\ntogether in good faith to consider amendments to this letter and to take such reasonable actions that are necessary, appropriate or\\ndesirable to avoid subjecting you to an additional tax or income recognition under Section 409A prior to actual payment of any\\npayments and benefits under this letter, as applicable. In no event will the Company be obligated to reimburse you for any taxes or\\ncosts that may be imposed on you as a result of Section 409A.\\n(f)\\nChoice of Law and Severability. This Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the\\nState in which you work/last worked without giving effect to provisions governing the choice of law. If any provision of this\\nAgreement becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any applicable jurisdiction by reason of the scope, extent or\\nduration of its coverage, then such provision shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to conform to applicable\\nlaw so as to be valid and enforceable or, if such provision cannot be so amended without materially altering the intention of the\\nparties, then such provision shall be stricken and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If any\\nprovision of this Agreement is rendered illegal by any present or future statute, law, ordinance or regulation (collectively, the\\n“Law”)  then  that  provision  shall  be  curtailed  or  limited  only  to  the  minimum  extent  necessary  to  bring  the  provision  into\\ncompliance with the Law. All the other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect without\\nimpairment or limitation.\\n(g)\\nNo Assignment. This Agreement and all of your rights and obligations hereunder are personal to you and\\nmay not be transferred or assigned by you at any time. The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to any entity that\\nassumes  the  Company’s  obligations  hereunder  in  connection  with  any  sale  or  transfer  of  all  or  a  substantial  portion  of  the\\nCompany’s assets to such entity.\\n(h)\\nCounterparts.

I understand that the Company is engaged in a continuous program of research, development,\\nproduction  and  marketing  in  connection  with  its  business  and  that  it  is  critical  for  the  Company  to  preserve  and  protect  its\\n“Confidential Information” (as defined in Section 8 below), its rights in “Inventions” (as defined in Section 3 below) and in all\\nrelated  intellectual  property  rights.  Accordingly,  I  am  entering  into  this  Employee  Invention  Assignment  and  Confidentiality\\nAgreement (this “Agreement”) as a condition  of my employment  with the  Company,  whether  or not I am expected  to create\\ninventions of value for the Company.\\n2.Inventions Retained and Licensed. I have attached hereto, as Exhibit A, a list describing all inventions, original works\\nof authorship, developments, improvements, and trade secrets which were made by me prior to my employment with the Company\\n(collectively, “Prior Inventions”), which belong to me, which relate to the Company’s proposed business, products or research\\nand development, and which are not assigned to the Company hereunder; or, if no such list is attached, I represent that there are no\\nsuch Prior Inventions. If in the course of my employment with the Company, I incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, into a\\nCompany product, process or service a Prior Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest, I hereby grant to the Company\\na nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use and sell\\nsuch Prior Invention as part of or in connection with such product, process or service, and to practice any method related thereto.\\n3.Disclosure of Inventions. I will promptly disclose in confidence to the Company all inventions, improvements, designs,\\noriginal  works  of  authorship,  formulas,  processes,  computer  software  programs,  databases,  and  trade  secrets  that  I  make  or\\nconceive or first reduce to practice or create, either alone or jointly with others, during the period of my employment, in the course\\nof my employment, and whether or not patentable, copyrightable or protectable as trade secrets (the “Inventions”).\\n4.Work for Hire; Assignment of Inventions. I acknowledge and agree that any copyrightable works prepared by me\\nwithin the scope of my employment are “works for hire” under the Copyright Act and other applicable law and that the Company\\nwill be considered the author and owner of such copyrightable works. I agree that all Inventions that (i) are developed using\\nequipment, supplies, facilities or trade secrets of the Company, (ii) result from work performed by me for the Company, or (iii)\\nrelate to the Company’s business or actual or demonstrably anticipated research and development (the “Assigned Inventions”), are\\nthe sole and exclusive property of the Company. I do hereby assign, the Assigned Inventions to the Company.\\n5.Labor Code Section 2870 Notice. This is notice required by the states of California, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, and\\nWashington, and any other such state requiring such notice, notifying employees in such states that they are not obligated to assign\\nto the Company any\\nrights in any invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the Company’s equipment,\\nsupplies,  facilities,  material  or trade  secret  information  unless  those  inventions  either  (1)  relate  to the Company’s  business  or\\nactual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company at the time the invention was made, or (2) result from\\nany work performed by the employee for the Company. Specifically, I have been notified and understand that the provisions of\\nSections 4 and 6 of this Agreement do not apply to any Assigned Invention that qualifies fully under the provisions of Section\\n2870 of the California Labor Code and similar laws. Section 2870 states as follows:\\nANY  PROVISION  IN  AN  EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT  WHICH  PROVIDES  THAT  AN  EMPLOYEE  SHALL\\nASSIGN,  OR  OFFER  TO  ASSIGN,  ANY  OF  HIS  OR  HER  RIGHTS  IN  AN  INVENTION  TO  HIS  OR  HER\\nEMPLOYER SHALL NOT APPLY TO AN INVENTION THAT THE EMPLOYEE DEVELOPED ENTIRELY ON\\nHIS OR HER OWN TIME WITHOUT USING THE EMPLOYER’S EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, FACILITIES, OR\\nTRADE  SECRET  INFORMATION  EXCEPT  FOR  THOSE  INVENTIONS  THAT  EITHER:  (I)  RELATE  AT  THE\\nTIME  OF  CONCEPTION  OR  REDUCTION  TO  PRACTICE  OF  THE  INVENTION  TO  THE  EMPLOYER’S\\nBUSINESS,  OR  ACTUAL  OR  DEMONSTRABLY  ANTICIPATED  RESEARCH  OR  DEVELOPMENT  OF  THE\\nEMPLOYER; OR (2) RESULT FROM ANY WORK PERFORMED BY THE EMPLOYEE FOR THE EMPLOYER.\\nTO  THE  EXTENT  A  PROVISION  IN  AN  EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT  PURPORTS  TO  REQUIRE  AN\\nEMPLOYEE  TO  ASSIGN  AN  INVENTION  OTHERWISE  EXCLUDED  FROM  BEING  REQUIRED  TO  BE\\nASSIGNED  UNDER  CALIFORNIA  LABOR  CODE  SECTION  2870(a),  THE  PROVISION  IS  AGAINST  THE\\nPUBLIC POLICY OF THIS STATE AND IS UNENFORCEABLE.\\n6.Assignment of Other Rights. In addition to the foregoing assignment of Assigned Inventions to the Company, I do\\nhereby irrevocably transfer and assign, to the Company: (i) all worldwide patents, patent applications, copyrights, mask works,\\ntrade secrets and other intellectual property rights, including but not limited to rights in databases, in any Assigned Inventions,\\nalong with any registrations of or applications to register such rights; and (ii) any and all “Moral Rights” (as defined below) that I\\nmay have in or with respect to any Assigned Inventions. I also hereby forever waive and agree never to assert any and all Moral\\nRights I may have in or with respect to any Assigned Inventions, even after termination of my work on behalf of the Company.\\n“Moral  Rights”  mean  any  rights  to  claim  authorship  of  or  credit  on  an  Assigned  Inventions,  to  object  to  or  prevent  the\\nmodification or destruction of any Assigned Inventions, or to withdraw from circulation or control the publication or distribution\\nof any Assigned Inventions, and any similar right, existing under judicial or statutory law of any country or subdivision thereof in\\nthe world, or under any treaty, regardless of whether or not such right is denominated or generally referred to as a “moral right.”\\n7.Assistance.  I  agree  to  assist  the  Company  in  every  proper  way  to  obtain  for  the  Company  and  enforce  patents,\\ncopyrights, mask work rights, trade secret rights and other legal protections for the Company’s Assigned Inventions in any and all\\ncountries. I will execute any documents that the Company may reasonably request for use in obtaining or enforcing such patents,\\ncopyrights, mask work rights, trade secrets and other legal protections. My obligations\\n2\\nunder this paragraph will continue beyond the termination of my employment with the Company, provided that the Company will\\ncompensate me at a reasonable rate after such termination for time or expenses actually spent by me at the Company’s request on\\nsuch  assistance.  I  appoint  the  Secretary  of  the  Company  as  my  attorney-in-fact  to  execute  documents  on  my  behalf  for  this\\npurpose.\\n8.Confidential Information. I understand that during my employment by the Company I will receive access to non-public\\ninformation  of  a  confidential  or  secret  nature  that  relates  to  the  business  of  the  Company  or  to  the  business  of  any  parent,\\nsubsidiary, affiliate, customer or supplier of the Company or any other party with whom the Company agrees to hold information\\nof such party in confidence, including, but not limited to, Assigned Inventions, trade secrets, marketing plans, market studies,\\nproduct plans, business strategies, financial information, forecasts, personnel information, customer lists and data, domain names,\\ninformation pertaining to the Company’s methods of operation, business plans, and financial, business or technical information\\n(the “Confidential Information”). I understand that Confidential Information does not include information regarding my own pay\\nand benefits, information as to the terms and conditions of employment, or information that is deemed not confidential under\\nSection 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, and that nothing in this Agreement will be construed as restricting my right to\\nengage in legally protected activities under applicable law, including participating in lawful government investigations.\\n9.Confidentiality. I agree that my employment by the Company creates a relationship of confidence and trust with respect\\nto any Confidential Information that may be disclosed to me by the Company or a third party in connection with my employment\\nby the Company. Accordingly, at all times, both during my employment and after its termination, I will keep and hold all such\\nConfidential Information in strict confidence and trust until such Confidential Information becomes publicly and widely known\\nand made generally available through no wrongful act of mine. I will not use or disclose any Confidential Information without the\\nprior  written  consent  of  the  Company  until  such  Confidential  Information  becomes  publicly  and  widely  known  and  made\\ngenerally available through no wrongful act of mine, except as may be necessary to perform my duties as an employee of the\\nCompany for the benefit of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I understand that this Agreement does not prevent me\\nfrom revealing evidence of criminal wrongdoing or other violations of the law to law enforcement or any government agency,\\nfrom divulging Confidential Information by order of court or agency of competent jurisdiction, or from making other disclosures\\nthat are protected under the provisions of applicable law or regulation.\\n10.\\nReturn of Company Property. Upon termination of my employment with the Company, I will immediately\\ndeliver to the Company all documents and materials of any nature pertaining to my work with the Company and all copies thereof\\nin my possession, custody, or control, in all formats (whether tangible, electronic, or otherwise), and, upon Company request, I\\nwill execute a document confirming my agreement to honor my responsibilities contained in this Agreement. I will not take with\\nme  or  retain  any  Company  property,  including  any  documents  or  materials  or  copies  thereof  containing  any  Confidential\\nInformation. Without limiting the foregoing, I further agree to provide the Company with access to any of my personal electronic\\ndevices, including computers and computer equipment, mobile devices, external storage devices, smart phones, tablets, and USB\\ndevices, that contain any Confidential Information or other\\n3\\nCompany property in order to allow the Company to remove said property at time of termination. I agree that it is my express\\nobligation to provide the Company with access to such personal electronic devices at my exit interview or before my last date of\\nemployment to accomplish the same.\\n11.\\nNo Breach of Prior Agreement. I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement and my\\nduties  as  an  employee  of  the  Company  will  not  breach  any  invention  assignment,  proprietary  information,  confidentiality  or\\nsimilar agreement with any former employer or other party. I represent that I will not bring with me to the Company or use in the\\nperformance of my duties for the Company any documents or materials or intangibles of a former employer or third party that are\\nnot generally available to the public or have not been legally transferred to the Company.\\n12.\\nEfforts; Duty of Loyalty. I understand that my employment with the Company requires my undivided attention\\nand effort. As a result, during my employment, I will not, without the company’s express written consent, engage in any other\\nemployment or business that (i) directly competes with the current or future business of the Company; (ii) uses any Company\\ninformation,  equipment,  supplies,  facilities  or  materials;  or  (iii)  otherwise  conflicts  with  the  Company’s  business  interest  and\\ncauses a disruption of its operations.\\n13.\\nNon-Solicitation of Employees/Consultants. During my employment with the Company and for a period of one\\n(1) year thereafter, I will not directly or indirectly solicit away employees or consultants of the Company for my own benefit or for\\nthe benefit of any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the above, this provision is not intended to restrict communications\\naddressed to the general public, such as advertising to fill open positions. Additionally, the post- termination restriction applies to\\nemployees who were employed during my employment with the Company.\\n14.\\nNon-Solicitation of Customers/Suppliers. During my employment with the Company and for a period of one\\n(1) year thereafter, I will not directly or indirectly solicit or otherwise take away customers or suppliers of the Company if, in so\\ndoing, I use or disclose any trade secrets of the Company. I agree that the non-public names and addresses of the Company’s\\ncustomers  and  suppliers,  and  all  other  confidential  information  related  to  them,  including  their  buying  and  selling  habits  and\\nspecial needs, created or obtained by me during my employment, constitute trade secrets or confidential information.\\n15.\\nNotification. I hereby authorize the Company to notify third parties, including, without limitation, customers and\\nactual or potential employers, of the terms of this Agreement and my responsibilities hereunder, as well as any alleged breaches\\nunder the Agreement.\\n16.\\nObligation  to  Supply  Information  and  Notify  Third  Parties  To  Ensure Protection  of  Company’s\\nConfidential Information. In order to protect the Company’s trade secrets and confidential information from improper use and\\ndisclosure, I agree to certain notification procedures. I shall notify my future employers of the terms of this Agreement and my\\nresponsibilities contained therein for a period of two years after my employment with the Company is terminated for any reason,\\nas specified below. I agree that, prior to the commencement of any new employment, I shall: 1) provide the Company with the\\nname and address of my new employer;\\n4\\n2) provide the Company with a general and public job description of my duties for the new employer; and 3) furnish my new employer\\nwith a copy of this Agreement.\\n17.\\nCertification and Exit Interview Requirement.

I also agree to make myself\\navailable for an exit interview with Company representative at the time of my departure from the Company.\\n18.\\nName & Likeness Rights. I hereby authorize the Company to use, reuse, and to grant others the right to use and\\nreuse,  my  name,  photograph,  likeness  (including  caricature),  voice,  and  biographical  information,  and  any  reproduction  or\\nsimulation thereof, in any form of media or technology now known or hereafter developed (including, but not limited to, film,\\nvideo and digital or other electronic media), both during and after my employment, for any purposes related to the Company’s\\nbusiness, such as marketing, advertising, credits, and presentations.\\n19.\\nInjunctive Relief. I understand that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by me the\\nCompany may suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement.\\n20.\\nGoverning Law; Severability. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws\\nof the state in which I resided at the time I executed this Agreement, without giving effect to its laws pertaining to conflict of laws.\\nIf any provision  of this Agreement  is determined  by any court  or arbitrator  of competent  jurisdiction  to be  invalid,  illegal  or\\nunenforceable in  any respect,  such provision  will be  enforced to  the maximum  extent possible  given the  intent of  the parties\\nhereto. If such clause or provision cannot be so enforced, such provision shall be stricken from this Agreement and the remainder\\nof  this  Agreement  shall  be  enforced  as  if  such  invalid,  illegal  or  unenforceable  clause  or  provision  had  (to  the  extent  not\\nenforceable) never been contained in this Agreement.\\n21.\\nCounterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed\\nand delivered will be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.\\n22.\\nEntire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and\\nunderstanding  of  the  parties  with  respect  to  the  subject  matter  of  this  Agreement,  and  supersede  all  prior  understandings  and\\nagreements, whether oral or written, between or among the parties hereto with respect to the specific subject matter hereof.\\n23.\\nAmendment and Waivers. This Agreement may be amended only by a written agreement executed by each of\\nthe parties hereto. No amendment of or waiver of, or modification of any obligation under this Agreement will be enforceable\\nunless set forth in a writing signed by the party against which enforcement is sought. Any amendment effected in accordance with\\nthis section will be binding upon all parties hereto and each of their respective successors and assigns. No delay or failure to\\nrequire performance of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a\\n5\\nwaiver of that provision as to that or any other instance. No waiver granted under this Agreement as to any one provision herein\\nshall constitute a subsequent waiver of such provision or of any other provision herein, nor shall it constitute the waiver of any\\nperformance other than the actual performance specifically waived.\\n24.\\nSuccessors and Assigns; Assignment. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement, and the\\nrights and obligations of the parties hereunder, will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns,\\nheirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.

I understand that this Agreement is intended to benefit each and every subsidiary,\\naffiliate, or business unit of the Company and any successors or assigns of the Company and may be enforced by any such entity. I\\nagree and intend to create a direct, consequential benefit to all such entities.\\n26.\\nNon-Impairment  of  Statutory  and  Common  Law.  I  understand  and  agree  that  nothing  in  this  Agreement\\nrelieves me of any duties or obligations I have to the Company under statutory or common law, which include but are not limited\\nto: fiduciary duties, the duty of loyalty, the duty not to tortiously interfere with business relationships, the duty not to engage in\\nunfair competition, and the duty not to misappropriate any Company trade secrets.\\n27.\\nFurther Assurances.

I  understand  that  this  Agreement  does  not  constitute  a  contract  of  employment  or\\nobligate the Company to employ me for any stated period of time. I understand that I am an “at will” employee of the Company\\nand that my employment can be terminated at any time, with or without notice and with or without cause, for any reason or for no\\nreason, by either the Company or myself. I acknowledge that any statements or representations to the contrary are ineffective,\\nunless  put  into  a  writing  signed  by  the  Company.  I  further  acknowledge  that  my  participation  in  any  stock  option  or  benefit\\nprogram is not to be construed as any assurance of continuing employment for any particular period of time.\\n29.\\nNotice  of  Immunity  under  the  Defend  Trade  Secrets  Act. Employee  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the\\nCompany has provided Employee with written notice below that the Defend Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b), provides an\\nimmunity for the disclosure of a trade secret to report a suspected violation of law and/or in an anti-retaliation lawsuit, as follows:\\n(1)\\nIMMUNITY. An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret\\nlaw for the disclosure of a trade secret that:\\n(A) is made\\n6\\n(i)\\nin confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an\\nattorney; and\\n(ii)\\nsolely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or\\n(B)\\nis made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made\\nunder seal.\\n(2)\\nUSE OF TRADE SECRET INFORMATION IN ANTI-RETALIATION LAWSUIT. An individual who files a\\nlawsuit  for  retaliation  by  an  employer  for  reporting  a  suspected  violation  of  law  may  disclose  the  trade  secret  to  the\\nattorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual:\\n(A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and\\n(B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.\\n30.\\nEffective Date of Agreement.    This Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement shall be\\neffective as of the first day of my employment by the\\nCompany, which is January 3, 2022.\\nLyft, Inc.:    Employee:\\nBy:     /s/ Logan Green         /s/ Elaine Paul    \\nSignature\\nName: Logan Green\\nElaine Paul\\nName (Please Print)\\nTitle:    Chief Executive Officer    Address:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n7\\nEXHIBIT A\\nPrior Inventions\\nN/A\\nATTACHMENT C ARBITRATION AGREEMENT\\n(See Attached)\\n-10-\\nMUTUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT\\n1.\\nDisputes Subject To Arbitration\\nLyft and I hereby agree that any and all claims, disputes or controversies between Lyft and me that arise out of or are related in any way to my\\nemployment relationship with Lyft (except those excluded below) shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration. For purposes of this Mutual\\nArbitration Agreement (the “Arbitration Agreement”), references to Lyft shall include Lyft, Inc., and/or any entity affiliated with or related to\\nLyft, Inc. (including their owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents,\\nand all successors and assigns of any of them). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after the\\nAgreement terminates or my relationship with Lyft ends. Any arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individual\\nbasis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. Lyft and I further expressly waive the right to a jury trial, and Lyft and I\\nagree that the arbitrator\\'s award will be final and binding on both parties.\\nThis  Arbitration  Agreement  is  intended  to  be  broadly  interpreted.  The  types  of  disputes  and  claims  covered  by  this  Arbitration  Agreement\\n(referred  to  below  as  “Claims”)  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  disputes  over  rights  provided  by  federal,  state,  or  local  statutes,  regulations,\\nordinances, and common law; claims related to salary, overtime, bonuses, vacation, paid time off, wages, meal and rest breaks, and any other\\nform of compensation; claims for breach of contract, wrongful discharge, fraud, defamation, emotional distress, retaliation and breach of the\\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and claims involving laws that prohibit discrimination and unlawful harassment based on any\\nprotected  classification,  including  claims  under  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  the  Age\\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, and any state employment statutes, such as the California Fair\\nEmployment & Housing Act, and the California Labor Code.\\n2.\\nDisputes Excluded From Arbitration\\nThis  Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  cover  claims  for  disability  and  medical  benefits  under  workers’  compensation  laws  or  claims  for\\nunemployment benefits. Likewise, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prohibits me from filing an administrative charge with the federal Equal\\nEmployment Opportunity Commission,\\nU.S.  Department  of  Labor,  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  National  Labor  Relations  Board,  the  Office  of  Federal  Contract  Compliance\\nPrograms, the California Department of Fair Employment & Housing, or any other similar local, state, or federal agency, or from participating in\\nany administrative agency investigation. Notwithstanding this Arbitration Provision, either Lyft or I may seek to obtain injunctive relief in court\\nto avoid irreparable harm that might take place prior to the resolution of any arbitration.\\n3.\\nClass Action/Collective Action Waiver\\nLyft and I agree to bring any Claims in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis. Accordingly, neither\\nI nor Lyft shall bring, nor shall the arbitrator preside over, any form of class or collective proceeding. In addition, unless all parties\\nagree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of more than one employee. Neither I nor Lyft may\\nseek, nor may the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other employees.\\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this section\\nmay be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If a court decides that applicable law does not permit the\\nenforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the\\narbitration and may be brought in court.\\n4.\\nRepresentative PAGA Waiver\\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, Lyft and I (1) agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of\\nothers under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in\\nany court or in arbitration, and (2) agree that for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, any\\nsuch dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether I have personally been aggrieved or subject\\nto any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective\\nproceeding (i.e.,  to  resolve  whether  other  individuals  have  been  aggrieved  or  subject  to  any  violations  of  law)  (collectively,  “representative\\nPAGA  Waiver”).  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Arbitration  Agreement, the  scope, applicability,  enforceability, revocability  or\\nvalidity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\\nIf any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision\\nshall be severed from this Arbitration Provision; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration\\nAgreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Provision; and (iii) any\\nsuch representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction\\nand not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that\\nthe representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed\\npending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.\\n5.\\nThe Arbitration Process\\nLyft and I agree that any dispute shall be addressed in the following manner: first, through good-faith negotiation between Lyft and me; second,\\nthrough a voluntary mediation paid for by Lyft, if both parties agree to mediation, administered by a mediator approved by Lyft and me; and\\nthird,  if  still  not  resolved,  by  final,  binding  and  confidential  arbitration.  The  arbitration  shall  be  administered  by  the  American  Arbitration\\nAssociation (“AAA”) pursuant to its Employment Arbitration Rules & Mediation Procedures then in effect. I understand that copies of these rules\\nare available to me at https://www.adr.org and that Lyft will provide me with copies upon my request. I acknowledge that I had a full and fair\\nopportunity to read and review these rules to the extent that I wished before accepting this Arbitration Agreement.\\nLyft and I agree that the procedures outlined in this Arbitration Agreement will be the exclusive means of resolution for any Claims covered by\\nthis Arbitration Agreement, whether such disputes are initiated by Lyft or by me.\\nLyft and I agree that the arbitration will take place in (1) San Francisco, California, (2) if I elect, in the county in which I was employed with the\\ncompany at the time that the dispute arose, or (3) at another location agreed to by the parties or if the parties cannot agree, at a location\\ndesignated by the arbitrator as a location convenient to both parties.\\nAs part of the arbitration, both Lyft and I will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the\\nClaim. The arbitrator, in his or her sole discretion, may permit any discovery necessary to allow either party to have a fair opportunity to pursue\\nthat party’s claims and defenses.\\n6.\\nPaying For The Arbitration\\nThe AAA’s rules will govern the amount and allocation of fees for the arbitration, subject to the provisions of this section. Lyft will pay any costs\\nthat are unique to the arbitration process, including fees for the arbitrator’s time and use of an arbitration forum. I will pay any costs that I am\\nrequired to pay under the AAA rules that would be imposed on me in a judicial forum, but in no event shall the AAA filing fee that I am\\nresponsible for paying exceed the filing fees that I would have paid if I had filed a complaint in a court of law having jurisdiction. I understand\\nthat I will be responsible for retaining my own attorney.\\n7.\\nThe Arbitration Award\\nThe arbitrator shall have authority to award monetary damages and any and all other individualized remedies\\nthat would be available in court, and the arbitrator’s decision of whether or not to award such damages and\\nremedies shall be based on the statute or common law upon which the arbitrated claim(s) is/are based. The\\narbitrator shall have authority to award to the prevailing party reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in either bringing or defending an\\naction under this Agreement, to the extent such costs or fees would be recoverable under the law or statute giving rise to the claim(s) arbitrated.\\nThe arbitrator will issue a written decision that memorializes the essential findings of fact and law and the conclusions upon which the\\narbitrator\\'s decision and the award, if any, are based.\\n8.\\nThe Arbitration Initiation Procedure\\nTo facilitate good-faith negotiations, I agree to send written notice to arbitrationnotice@lyft.com stating the nature of my claim in sufficient\\ndetail to advise Lyft of the nature of the dispute and the relief I request. I agree that I will provide Lyft with that notice at least 45 days before\\ninitiating any arbitration under this Arbitration Provision. Lyft agrees to do the same if it initiates any claim against me. I understand that the\\nnotice will be used to investigate the claim, so that Lyft and I can engage in good-faith negotiations to resolve it promptly.\\n9.\\nThe Arbitration Agreement Opt-Out Procedure\\nI acknowledge that I have the opportunity to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. To do so, I must provide notice in writing to Lyft’s Legal\\nDepartment (by email to arbitrationnotice@lyft.com or by postal mail to Legal Department, Attn: Employment Counsel; Lyft, Inc.; 185 Berry\\nStreet; Suite 5000, San Francisco, CA 94107) specifically stating that I do not wish to be bound by this Arbitration Agreement. I understand that\\nsuch notice must be e-mailed or postmarked within thirty days (30 days) of my receipt of this Agreement in order to opt out. I understand that I\\nwill not be penalized in any manner for opting out of the Agreement.\\n10.\\nEnforcement Of The Arbitration Agreement\\nThis Arbitration Agreement is the full and complete agreement relating to the resolution of disputes between Lyft and me. In the event any\\nportion of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable except as otherwise\\nprovided above.\\n******************************************************************************************\\n*******************\\nMy signature below indicates that I understand and agree to be legally bound by this Mutual Arbitration Agreement, including its waiver\\nof jury trials and class, representative, and private attorney general actions.\\nElaine Paul\\n/s/ Elaine Paul\\nNovember 26, 2021\\nEmployee Name\\nSignature\\nDate\\nLogan Green\\n/s/ Logan Green\\nNovember 24, 2021\\nLyft Representative Name\\nSignature\\nDate\\nExhibit 10.15\\nCONFIDENTIAL SEPARATION AGREEMENT & GENERAL RELEASE\\nThis Confidential Separation Agreement and General Release (“Agreement”) is entered into by Brian Roberts (“Employee”), and Lyft, Inc.\\n(the “Company”) (Employee and the Company each a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”) in connection with Employee’s separation of\\nemployment from the Company. Employee and the Company acknowledge and agree as follows:\\nWHEREAS, Employee’s employment with the Company will end on the Separation Date (as defined below) by way of voluntary\\nresignation; and\\nWHEREAS, the Company and Employee desire to set forth the terms of Employee’s separation and wish to resolve any and all claims that\\nEmployee may have against the Company and any of the Released Parties (as defined below);\\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby\\nacknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\\n1.\\nSeparation of Employment. Employee’s employment with the Company will end on December 1, 2021 (the “Separation Date”),\\nand Employee hereby resigns as Chief Financial Officer of the Company and from any and all positions as an officer or director of any subsidiary of\\nthe Company. On and after the Separation Date, Employee shall no longer identify or hold themselves out as an employee of the Company and will\\nnot be authorized to bind or speak on behalf of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, Employee’s employment with the Company ends as of the\\nSeparation Date whether or not Employee executes this Agreement.\\n2.\\nSeverance Pay. If and only if Employee timely signs and does not revoke this Agreement and complies with its terms, then as\\nconsideration, the adequacy of which Employee hereby acknowledges, the Company agrees to pay Employee a severance payment in the gross\\namount of $75,000, less lawful payroll deductions and withholdings (“Severance Pay”), an amount to which Employee acknowledges Employee is\\nnot otherwise entitled. The Company will make such payment within 15 business days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, as defined in Section\\n16, or the Separation Date, whichever date is later (but in all cases no earlier than January 3, 2022). By Employee’s signature below, Employee\\nauthorizes the Company to pay the Severance Pay by direct deposit into Employee’s bank account on file in the Company’s records.\\n3.\\nEquity. The Company previously granted Employee equity award(s) to purchase or receive shares of the Company’s Class A\\ncommon stock set forth on Schedule 1 that remain outstanding as of the date Employee was presented with this Agreement (collectively“Equity\\nAwards”), subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Company equity plan and the award agreement evidencing such Equity Awards\\n(collectively the “Equity Documents”). The parties acknowledge that the Equity Awards will be governed by the terms of the Equity Documents.\\nEmployee acknowledges and agrees that he remains subject to the Company’s Insider Trading Policy. Employee agrees that he has no rights to\\nCompany Equity Awards other than as described in this Section 3 and Employee’s Consulting Agreement dated December 1, 2021.\\n4.\\nContinuation of Health Benefits.\\n(a) Employee will continue to receive Employee’s current benefits, if any, under the Company-sponsored benefit plans, for the period\\nthrough the last day of the month in which Employee’s Separation Date occurs. Beginning on the Separation Date, Employee may be eligible to elect\\ncontinuation coverage under the Company’s group medical, dental, and vision insurance plans for Employee and their eligible dependents. Such\\neligibility and coverage will be governed exclusively by the continuation coverage provisions of the Company’s group insurance plans (which may\\nbe amended from time to time) and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (“COBRA”).\\n(b) A “qualifying event” for purposes of COBRA coverage occurred on the Separation Date. The Company or its administrator will send\\nEmployee COBRA notification separate from this Agreement, but also hereby notifies Employee that instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation\\ncoverage, there may be\\nother more affordable coverage options through the federal Health Insurance Marketplace, state exchange, Medicaid, or other group health plan\\ncoverage options (such as a spouse’s plan) through what is called a “special enrollment period.”  Employee understands that Employee should\\ncarefully consider whether COBRA continuation coverage is the best option for Employee. Employee will be solely responsible for continuing\\ncoverage through COBRA. If Employee signs up for COBRA continuation coverage, Employee will be limited in when Employee may switch to a\\nMarketplace or exchange plan in the future depending on the plan’s “special enrollment period.” Employee will be solely responsible for paying any\\nCOBRA or other health premiums and administrative costs required to maintain insurance coverage, whether under the Company’s group health plan\\nfor the COBRA period or any other health insurance plan.\\n5.\\nAll Wages, Benefits and Expenses Paid in Full. Employee acknowledges that all wages, vacation/PTO, benefits, overtime, meal\\nand rest premiums, business expenses, bonuses, incentive pay and any other compensation, and any other amounts that might be owed to him by the\\nCompany were paid in full as of the Separation Date, including any compensation and benefits under the Company’s Executive Change in Control\\nand Severance Plan (the “Severance Plan”) for which Employee signed a participation agreement on March 13, 2019. Employee agrees that\\nEmployee has submitted, or will submit within 10 days of the Separation Date, any outstanding business expenses for reimbursement and such\\nexpenses will be handled pursuant to standard Company policy. Other than the obligations in Sections 2, 3 and 4, Employee acknowledges and\\nagrees that the Company has no further financial obligations to Employee, and the Company shall make no further payments or contributions on\\nEmployee’s behalf. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the circumstances of Employee’s separation of employment do not qualify Employee\\nfor payments or benefits under the Severance Plan.\\n6.\\nNonadmission of Liability. Employee acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement, including the foregoing consideration,\\nconstitutes an admission of liability, express or implied, on the part of the Company with respect to any fact or matter which may be involved in\\nEmployee’s employment with or separation of employment from the Company. Employee further acknowledges that the Company denies that it or\\nany of its employees, officers, directors, and/or agents ever acted toward Employee in a manner that would constitute a violation of any\\nconstitutional, statutory or common law right, whether that right arises under state, federal or local law.\\n7.\\nGeneral Release and Covenant Not to Sue.\\n    (a) Employee (for Employee’s self and Employee’s heirs, administrators, executors, agents and assigns) does hereby fully and forever release,\\nwaive, discharge and covenant not to sue the Company or any related or affiliated entity, or its or their respective current or former parent entities,\\nofficers, employees, directors, insurers, agents, attorneys, benefit plans, and assigns, and any predecessors or successors of the foregoing\\n(collectively, the “Released Parties”), with respect to any and all claims, assertions of claims, debts, demands, actions, suits, expenses, attorneys’\\nfees, costs, damages and/or liabilities of any nature, type and description, known or unknown, at law or in equity, arising out of any fact or matter in\\nany way connected with Employee’s employment with the Company, the separation thereof, or any other related matter arising before the effective\\ndate of this Agreement. This release shall include but is not limited to any rights or claims under federal, state or local law (whether arising from\\nstatute, executive order, regulation, code, or constitution, or other source), including but not limited to claims arising under Title VII of the Civil\\nRights Act of 1964, as amended, Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Fair Labor Standards Act (to the extent subject to a waiver of this\\nsort), the Equal Pay Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination\\nin Employment Act of 1967 (“ADEA”), the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, the\\nGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the\\nWorkers Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, the Fair Credit\\nReporting Act, the anti-retaliation provisions of the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002 (also known as the Sarbanes-Oxley\\nAct and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Report Consumer Protection Act), Cal-OSHA, the California Fair Employment & Housing Act, the California\\nLabor Code, the California Government Code, the California Family Rights Act, the California Civil Code, the California Business & Professions\\nCode, each as amended, rights to rehire and reemployment, and any and all common law claims, including claims sounding in tort or contract, claims\\nfor compensation, benefits, equity, or other remuneration or attorneys’\\n2\\nfees, costs or disbursements, claims for physical or emotional distress or injuries, claims for discrimination, harassment, retaliation, failure to\\naccommodate, violation of public policy, breach of express or implied contract, breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\\ndefamation or misrepresentation, and any claims arising under any other duty or obligation of any kind or description, whether arising in law or\\nequity, which can lawfully be released under federal, state, or local law. The foregoing is a non-exhaustive list, and this release is intended to cover\\nall claims that may be lawfully waived by agreement, including those not specifically listed. The parties agree and acknowledge that the payments\\nmade pursuant to this Agreement are not related to sexual harassment.\\n(b) Covenant Not to Sue. Besides waiving rights and releasing claims encompassed by the General Release in Section 7(a) above, Employee\\npromises not to bring a lawsuit or arbitration against the Company alleging any claim or violation of rights covered by that General Release. This\\nCovenant Not to Sue is different from the General Release in that it is an affirmative promise by Employee, violation of which can result in a claim\\nfor damages by the Company against Employee. Details regarding exceptions to this covenant and damages Employee must pay for violating it are\\ncontained in Sections 7(d) and 18 below.\\n(c) Waiver of Unknown Claims. This general and complete release covers both claims that Employee knows about and those that Employee\\nmay not know about and that exist in Employee’s favor at the time of executing this Agreement. Employee understands and for valuable\\nconsideration hereby expressly agrees that in the event of any injury, loss, or damage sustained by Employee which is not now known or suspected,\\nor in the event that the losses or damages now known or suspected have present or future consequences not now known or suspected, this Agreement\\nshall nevertheless constitute a full and final release as to the Company, and that this Agreement shall apply to all such known or unsuspected injuries,\\nlosses, damages or consequences.\\nEmployee understands and for valuable consideration hereby expressly waives all of the rights and benefits of Section 1542 of the California\\nCivil Code, which section reads as follows:\\nA GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING\\nPARTY  DOES  NOT  KNOW  OR  SUSPECT  TO  EXIST  IN  HIS  OR  HER  FAVOR  AT  THE  TIME  OF\\nEXECUTING  THE  RELEASE  AND  THAT,  IF  KNOWN  BY  HIM  OR  HER,  WOULD  HAVE\\nMATERIALLY  AFFECTED  HIS  OR  HER  SETTLEMENT  WITH  THE  DEBTOR  OR  RELEASED\\nPARTY.\\nEmployee  also  understands  and  agrees  that  this  is  a  “negotiated  severance  agreement”  as  that  term  is  used  under  California  law  because  it  is\\nvoluntary, deliberate, and informed, provides consideration of value to Employee, and Employee has been given notice and an opportunity to retain\\nan attorney or is represented by an attorney.\\n(d) Matters Not Waived. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Employee is not waiving, releasing or giving up any\\nclaim for workers’ compensation benefits or unemployment benefits to which the Employee has an unwaivable right, vested pension or savings plan\\nbenefits, claims to enforce this Agreement, claims under sections 2800 to 2810 of the California Labor Code, and claims under other state statutes\\nthat may not be waived as a matter of law in an agreement of this type. Employee acknowledges, however, that Employee has no work-related injury\\nor illness at the time of signing this Agreement for which Employee has not already filed a workers compensation claim. Nothing in any part of this\\nAgreement limits or waives Employee’s right to file a charge with an administrative agency, provide testimony or other information to an agency, or\\ntake part in any agency investigation; however, Employee is waiving Employee’s right to recover any monetary or other relief in connection with\\nsuch an investigation or charge filed by Employee or by any other individual, or a charge filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\\nor any other federal, state or local agency. If Employee is awarded money damages as described in the previous sentence, Employee shall decline to\\naccept any such monetary award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and the limitation on monetary recovery does not limit Employee’s\\nright to receive any statutory or otherwise authorized award for information provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Employee does\\nnot waive any rights or claims that arise after the effective date of this Agreement.\\n3\\n8.\\nAdequate Consideration. Employee acknowledges that the consideration Employee is receiving under this Agreement, including\\nbut not limited to the Severance Pay, constitutes a benefit to which Employee is not otherwise entitled under any policy, statute, law, or any\\nagreement between the Company and Employee, and is adequate consideration for Employee’s covenants and obligations under this Agreement,\\nincluding the General Release.\\n9.\\nNo Pending Litigation. Employee hereby represents that there is no pending action filed (either by Employee or on Employee’s\\nbehalf) in any court of law, in arbitration, or in any other legal forum against the Company or any of the Released Parties or any other person, entity\\nor corporation in connection with Employee’s employment with the Company.\\n10.\\nProperty of Employer. Employee represents that Employee has returned to the Company all property of the Company, including but\\nnot limited to any keys, access cards, passwords, or equipment belonging to the Company and documents, records, and data in paper or electronic\\nformat, as well as all copies of such materials. Employee also agrees to make a good-faith reasonable effort to delete all electronic copies of any such\\nmaterials in Employee’s possession (including on any personal device) following return of such electronic documents to the Company. Employee\\nacknowledges and understands that such property, documents and materials are proprietary to the Company. In the event that Employee fails to\\nreturn all such property, the Company’s obligation under this Agreement shall cease, including the payment obligations described above.\\n11.\\nReference Inquiries. Employee should instruct any prospective employers to direct their reference inquiries to the Human\\nResources Department. In the event the Human Resources Department receives any inquiries from prospective employers, the Human Resources\\nDepartment will respond by advising that the Company’s policy is to provide information only as to service dates and positions held and by\\nproviding such information.\\n12.\\nConfidentiality Matters.\\n(a) Confidential or Proprietary Information. Employee acknowledges that, by reason of Employee’s employment, Employee had access to\\nconfidential, proprietary, and trade secret information (including customer lists not known to the public) of the Company, and that Employee\\nunderstands Employee’s obligations under the law and agrees not to disclose or divulge to any third party or otherwise use or allow to be used in any\\nmanner (whether for Employee’s benefit, for the benefit of another individual or entity, or otherwise) any confidential, trade secret or proprietary\\ninformation concerning the operations or business of the Company at any time following the Separation Date. These obligations shall not apply to\\ninformation that (i) is now a part of public knowledge or literature or is generally known in the industry; or (ii) hereafter becomes a part of the public\\nknowledge or generally known in the industry from a source other than Employee, either directly or indirectly. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement\\nshall limit Employee’s ability to report possible violations of law in confidence to the appropriate government agency or entity or make other\\ndisclosures protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable federal or state law or regulation. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of\\n2016, Employee will not face civil or criminal liability for disclosing a trade secret: (1) to a government official or an attorney, if the disclosure is\\nmade in confidence and for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) in a document filed in a lawsuit or other\\nproceeding, provided the document is filed under seal. In addition, if Employee files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a\\nsuspected violation of law, Employee may disclose a trade secret to Employee’s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,\\nprovided the document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and Employee does not otherwise disclose the trade secret except pursuant to\\ncourt order. The confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations in this paragraph are in addition to, and not in lieu of, Employee’s obligations under\\nthe Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement that Employee signed on October 6, 2014 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”),\\nand Employee will remain bound by the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, at all times in the future, even after the Separation Date.\\n(b) Confidentiality of Agreement. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this Agreement, to the extent they are not publicly\\ndisclosed by the Company are ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the terms of this Agreement, unless\\npreviously publicly disclosed by the Company shall not, without the Company’s prior written consent, be disclosed\\n4\\nto any person, firm, organization or entity, including but not limited to any current or former employees of the Company. Except as provided in this\\nparagraph, Employee shall not: (a) communicate or disclose in any way the amount of the Severance Pay or benefits made by the Company; or\\n(b) give any indication of the amount of the Severance Pay. Employee may communicate the terms and conditions of this Agreement (1) to\\nEmployee’s spouse/domestic partner; or (2) to Employee’s attorney and those rendering financial or legal advice and having a bona fide need to\\nknow such terms and conditions; provided, however, Employee shall advise any such individuals beforehand of the existence of Employee’s\\nconfidentiality obligations under this Agreement and their corresponding obligations to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement. A breach of\\nthese obligations by Employee’s spouse/domestic partner, attorney, advisor, or agents will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Employee.\\nMoreover, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Employee from disclosing the terms and conditions of this Agreement to government agencies\\nfor tax purposes (i.e., the IRS and Franchise Tax Board); or if required by a valid court order, subpoena, or regulatory request or other compulsory\\nprocess or law; provided, however, that Employee shall advise such agency or court of the confidential nature of this Agreement and shall exercise\\nreasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the subject matter disclosed. Further, the Company\\nagrees that it will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to not publicly disclose any potential employment opportunity Employee may have\\nprior to Employee or Employee’s new employer/company announcing it, with the exception of required disclosures to the Company’s Board of\\nDirectors or advisors, or required by law, under applicable confidentiality obligations.\\n(c) Breach of Confidentiality Provisions/Liquidated Damages. Employee agrees that if Employee, Employee’s attorney, or Employee’s\\naccountant, financial advisor or spouse/domestic partner breaches the promise to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the Severance\\nPay, then the resulting damage to the Company would be impracticable or extremely difficult to determine because of the uncertain effect of the\\ndisclosure of such information on the Company’s present and future business prospects. Because of the difficulty of determining the damages\\nresulting from any such breach of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, the parties agree that in the event of such a breach by Employee\\neither directly by Employee or indirectly through Employee’s spouse, attorney or agents, Employee shall be obligated to re-pay to the Company the\\nsum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) as liquidated damages for each occurrence, which amount Employee agrees is reasonable. Nothing herein shall\\nlimit or restrict any other remedies available to the Company, at law or in equity, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by Employee of any\\nobligations under this Agreement.    \\n13.\\nCooperation. Following the Separation Date, Employee also agrees to cooperate with the Company in regard to the transition of the\\nbusiness matters handled by Employee on behalf of the Company. Employee agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Company and its counsel in the\\ndefense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company, or in\\nany investigation or review that may be performed by the Company or any governmental authority, which relate in any way to events or occurrences\\nthat transpired while Employee was employed by the Company or about which Employee may have knowledge. Employee’s cooperation in\\nconnection with such claims, actions, or investigations will include, but not be limited to, being available to meet with the Company’s counsel to\\nprepare for discovery or any legal proceeding, executing documents, and providing truthful testimony as a witness on behalf of the Company at\\nmutually convenient times. The Company will reimburse Employee for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket costs and expenses (but not\\nincluding attorneys’ fees) that Employee incurs in connection with obligations under this paragraph.\\n14.\\nNon-Disparagement. The Parties agree that they will not disparage, discredit or otherwise defame one another, including the\\nCompany or its officers, directors and employees, in any form, manner, or media, including but not limited to oral or written statements, social\\nmedia, or any other form of electronic communication, or otherwise take any action which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the\\npersonal or business reputation of the Parties. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Parties from testifying truthfully in any valid judicial or\\ngovernment agency proceeding.\\n15.\\nArbitration. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties agree to resolve any disputes that they may have with each other\\nregarding the validity, interpretation, applicability, or effect of this Agreement or any alleged violations of it, through final, binding, and confidential\\narbitration with JAMS, in accordance with JAMS employment law rules, available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-\\n5\\nemployment-arbitration/. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco before a single experienced JAMS arbitrator licensed to practice law in\\nCalifornia and mutually selected by the parties. The arbitrator may not modify or change this Agreement in any way. Unless otherwise required by\\nlaw, all costs incidental to the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator, the costs of any record or transcript of the arbitration required to be\\npurchased, and administrative and filing fees shall be paid in equal shares by Employee (one-half) and the Company (one-half) at such time as they\\nbecome due. Each party shall bear its own attorneys fees and costs, unless otherwise required or allowed by law and awarded by the arbitrator, as\\nprovided for below. Any arbitration may be initiated by a written demand to the other party identifying all claims forming the basis of the demand in\\nsufficient detail to inform the other party of the substance of the claims. In no event shall the demand for arbitration be made after the date when\\ninstitution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claims would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The arbitrator shall resolve\\nall claims regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration.  The parties further agree that this Agreement is intended to be strictly\\nconstrued to provide for arbitration as the sole and exclusive means for resolution of all disputes hereunder to the fullest extent permitted by law.\\n The parties expressly waive any entitlement to have such controversies decided by a court or a jury and agree to bring any arbitration on an\\nindividual basis only, and not on a class, collective, or representative basis. The party losing the arbitration shall reimburse the prevailing party for all\\narbitration costs and expenses that the prevailing party paid pursuant to the provision of this paragraph, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees.\\n16.\\nOlder Workers’ Benefit Protection Act. This Agreement is intended to satisfy the requirements of the Older Workers’ Benefit\\nProtection Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 626(f) (the “OWBPA”). Employee is advised to consult with an attorney before executing this agreement.\\n(a)\\nAcknowledgments/Time to Consider. Employee acknowledges and agrees that (i) Employee has read and understands the terms of\\nthis Agreement; (ii) by way of this Agreement, Employee has been advised in writing that Employee has a right to consult with an attorney of\\nEmployee’s choosing before executing this Agreement; (iii) Employee has obtained and considered such legal counsel as Employee deems necessary\\nor, by Employee’s own choice, has elected not to consult legal counsel; (iv) Employee has been given twenty-one (21) days to consider whether or\\nnot to enter into this Agreement (although Employee may elect not to use the full 21-day period at Employee’s option, and to sign and return this\\nAgreement earlier, but not before the Separation Date) at Employee’s option; and (v) by signing this Agreement, Employee acknowledges that\\nEmployee does so freely, knowingly, and voluntarily, without any coercion or undue influence from anyone.\\n(b)\\nRevocation/Effective Date. If Employee timely signs this Agreement, Employee may revoke Employee’s acceptance of this\\nAgreement within seven (7) days after the date Employee signs it. Employee’s revocation must be in writing to Lindsay Llewellyn, and received by\\nLyft on or before the seventh day after signing it in order to be effective. If Employee does not revoke acceptance within the seven (7) day period,\\nEmployee’s acceptance of this Agreement shall become binding and enforceable on the eighth day after Employee signs the Agreement (“Effective\\nDate”). If Employee fails to timely sign this Agreement or revokes this Agreement as provided for above, the Agreement shall have no force or\\neffect and Employee shall have no right to the arrangements, payments, or benefits referenced above.\\n(c)\\nPreserved Rights of Employee. This Agreement does not waive or release ay rights or claims that Employee may have under the\\nAge Discrimination Employment Act (“ADEA”) that arise after the execution of this Agreement. In addition, this Agreement does not prohibit\\nEmployee from challenging the validity of this Agreement’s waiver and release of claims under the ADEA.\\n17.\\nUse of Agreement. Employee and the Company agree that this Agreement may be used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding in\\nwhich either of the Parties alleges a breach of this Agreement, notwithstanding the confidentiality provisions above; provided that if this Agreement\\nis filed in a proceeding, it shall be filed under seal consistent with applicable court rules and any testimony regarding this Agreement shall be\\ndesignated as confidential to the fullest extent permitted by law.\\n18.\\nAttorneys’ Fees. Employee and the Company agree that if any action is brought to enforce the terms, conditions and provisions of\\nthis Agreement (including but not limited to the mandatory arbitration provision), the prevailing party will be entitled to all reasonable costs and\\nattorneys’ fees incurred in enforcing any of the terms, conditions and provisions hereof, except with\\n6\\nregard to a legal action challenging or seeking a determination in good faith of the validity of this Agreement’s waiver under the ADEA.\\n19.\\nCaptions. The captions in this Agreement have been inserted for identification and reference purposes only and shall not be used in\\nthe construction or interpretation of this Agreement.\\n20.\\nCounterparts/By Facsimile or Electronic Copy. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts by facsimile copy or electronic\\ncopy, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.\\n21.\\nSeverability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality\\nand/or enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; provided that if the General Release above is\\nheld to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, then Employee agrees that Employee shall be required to enter into a new agreement containing an\\nenforceable release of all legally waivable claims against the Company and that the Severance Pay, and any other consideration provided herein, will\\nconstitute sufficient consideration for such new agreement. If any terms or sections of this Agreement are determined to be unenforceable, they shall\\nbe modified so that the unenforceable term or section is enforceable to the greatest extent possible.\\n22.\\nGoverning Law. This Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with California law, without reference to its conflict of law\\nprinciples, except that the FAA governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration provision above.\\n23.\\nEntire Agreement; Amendment. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement is the entire agreement between\\nEmployee and the Company regarding Employee’s employment with and separation from the Company, and supersedes any prior oral or written\\nagreements or understandings, except that at all times in the future, Employee will remain bound by the Confidentiality Agreement and Equity\\nDocuments, in accordance with their terms. The Company and Employee acknowledge that they have entered into this Agreement without reliance\\non any representation, inducement, or promise that is not contained in this Agreement. Employee acknowledges that Employee has entered into this\\nAgreement with the full intent of releasing all of Employee’s claims against the Company and the Released Parties (to the fullest extent permitted by\\nlaw), and Employee is fully aware of the legal and binding effect of this Agreement, including the General Release set forth herein. Employee also\\nunderstands and agrees that this is a “negotiated severance agreement” as that term is used under California law because it is voluntary, deliberate,\\nand informed, provides consideration of value to Employee, and Employee has been given notice and an opportunity to retain an attorney or is\\nrepresented by an attorney. This Agreement may not be amended or modified, except with the written consent of the Parties. Employee agrees and\\nacknowledges that the Company is not providing any tax advice in connection with this Agreement and Employee is solely responsible for\\nEmployee’s tax consequences from this Agreement. The Company agrees and acknowledges that it has the obligations to collect and remit applicable\\npayroll taxes from the payments under this Agreement.\\n[SIGNATURES APPEAR ON NEXT PAGE]\\n7\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the dates listed below.\\nPLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND GENERAL RELEASE CAREFULLY.

However, the Company agrees to use its commercially\\nreasonable best efforts to not send Consultant any material, non-public information regarding the Company (MNPI) during the term of the\\nConsultancy.\\n7.2\\nThe  Consultant  agrees  that  the  Confidential  Information  will  be  used  by  the  Consultant  only  in  connection  with\\nconsulting activities hereunder.\\n7.3\\nThe  Consultant  agrees  not  to  disclose,  directly  or  indirectly,  the  Confidential  Information  to  any  third  person  or\\nentity, other than representatives or agents of the Company.\\n7.4\\nThe term “Confidential Information” does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the\\npublic other than by disclosure in violation of this Agreement, (ii) was within the Consultant’s possession prior to being furnished to the\\nConsultant by the Company, as shown by written records, (iii) becomes available to the Consultant on a non-confidential basis without\\nbreach  of  any  confidentiality  obligation  to  the  Company,  or  (iv)  was  independently  developed  by  Consultant  without  reference  to  the\\ninformation provided by the Company, as shown by written records.\\n7.5\\nThe  Consultant  may  disclose  any  Confidential  Information  that  is  required  to  be  disclosed  by  law,  government\\nregulation or court order. If disclosure is required, the\\n3\\n4857-0921-6260.2\\nConsultant will give the Company advance notice so that the Company may seek a protective order or take other action reasonable in light\\nof the circumstances.\\n7.6\\nUpon  termination  of  this  Agreement,  the  Consultant  will  promptly  return  to  the  Company  all  materials  in\\nConsultant’s possession containing Confidential Information, as well as data, records, reports and other property, furnished by the Company\\nto the Consultant or produced by the Consultant in connection with services rendered hereunder, together with all copies in Consultant’s\\npossession  of  any  of  the  foregoing. Notwithstanding  such  return,  the  Consultant  shall  continue  to  be  bound  by  the  terms  of  the\\nconfidentiality provisions contained in this Section 7 for a period of three years after the termination of this Agreement.\\n8.\\nArbitration.\\n8.1\\nAgreement to Arbitrate.  In exchange for the benefits of the speedy, economical, and impartial dispute resolution\\nprocedure of arbitration, Consultant and the Company mutually forego their right to resolution of disputes in a court of law by a judge or\\njury, and, as set forth herein, agree to arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.\\n8.2\\nDisputes  Covered  by  Arbitration.  Consultant  and  the  Company  agree  that  any  and  all  claims,  disputes  or\\ncontroversies between Consultant and the Company arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement (including its enforcement,\\nbreach, performance, interpretation, validity, or termination), including any claims arising out of or related in any way to Consultant’s\\nrelationship with or Services for the Company and/or its affiliates, shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration to the fullest extent\\nallowed by law.  This arbitration obligation shall apply to any and all claims, causes of action, in law or equity of any nature whatsoever,\\nwhether arising in contract, tort or statute, between Consultant and the Company and/or their affiliated entities (including their owners,\\ndirectors, managers, employees, agents, and officers), unless the particular dispute or claim is expressly exempted from arbitration. By\\nagreeing to this dispute resolution and arbitration agreement, Consultant and the Company expressly waive the right to sue in\\ncourt and have a jury or judge decide their claim, dispute, or controversy.\\n8.3\\nDelegation  of  Arbitrability.     Consultant  and  the  Company  expressly  delegate  to  the  arbitrator  the  authority  to\\ndetermine the arbitrability of any dispute, including the scope, applicability, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration provision.\\n8.4\\nDisputes  Not  Covered  by  Arbitration. This  arbitration  provision  does  not  include:  (1)  a  claim  for  workers’\\ncompensation  benefits;  (2)  a  claim  for  unemployment  compensation  benefits;  or  (3)  a  claim  under  the  National  Labor  Relations  Act\\n(“NLRA”), as amended.  In addition, in lieu of arbitration of any dispute covered by this arbitration provision, Consultant or the Company\\nmay bring any such dispute in small claims court in their individual, as opposed to a class or representative capacity.\\n8.5\\nClass Action Waiver.  Except as otherwise required under applicable law, both Consultant and the Company\\nagree that each may bring any and all claims against the other only in an individual capacity, and not as a named-plaintiff or class\\nmember in any purported class or representative proceeding.  However, the waiver of representative claims shall not apply to any claim\\nbrought under California’s Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”), if applicable.  Consultant and the Company further agree that, in the\\nevent that the agreement to not bring claims on a class or representative basis is deemed unenforceable in state or federal court proceedings,\\nthen their individual claims shall be resolved\\n4\\n4857-0921-6260.2\\nfirst by arbitration, with any class or representative claims stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration.\\n8.6\\nStatutes  of  Limitations,  Scope  of  Remedies,  Discovery,  and  Substantive  Law. Statutes  of  limitations,  scope  of\\nremedies, and substantive law (including any requirement for prior exhaustion of administrative agency relief) shall be the same as would\\nbe applicable were any action to be brought in court and shall not be limited by the fact that any dispute is subject to arbitration.  As part of\\nthe arbitration, both Consultant and the Company will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is\\nrelevant to their dispute. Notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration\\nconducted pursuant to the terms of this agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\\n8.7\\nAdministration of Arbitration.  The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the\\n“AAA”) before one arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if no agreement can be reached within thirty (30) days after names\\nof potential arbitrators have been proposed by the parties or AAA, then by one arbitrator having reasonable experience in matters of the\\ntype provided for in this Agreement and who is chosen by the AAA. The arbitration shall take place in the county in which Consultant was\\nworking  with  the  Company  at  the  time  that  the  dispute  arose,  or  any  other  jurisdiction  mutually  agreed  upon  by  Consultant  and  the\\nCompany. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect, which rules can be\\nfound at www.adr.org, or which can be obtained by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or which will be provided by the Company upon\\nrequest.  However, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to decide to apply the AAA Employment Rules, or the AAA Commercial Rules,\\nwhere a dispute is more appropriately arbitrated under those rules.  The arbitrator shall be required to provide in writing to the parties the\\nbasis for the award or order of such arbitrator, and a court reporter shall record all hearings, with such record constituting the official\\ntranscript of such proceedings.  The arbitrator shall have the power to decide any motions brought by any party to the arbitration. Judgment\\nupon any award rendered in such arbitration will be binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\\n8.8\\nArbitration Costs.       To the extent required by law, the Company shall pay for any administrative or hearing fees\\ncharged  by AAA.   Subject  to the foregoing  limitation,  to the  extent  permitted  by  the  AAA rules,  Consultant  shall  pay  any filing  fees\\nassociated  with any arbitration  that Consultant  initiates,  unless Consultant  qualifies  for fee waivers  or other forms of cost relief at the\\ndiscretion of the arbitrator, but in no event shall Consultant’s AAA filing fee exceed the filing fees that Consultant would have paid if\\nConsultant had filed a complaint in a court of law having jurisdiction.\\n8.9\\nOptional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process.  Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, Consultant and the\\nCompany may agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim, or controversy between the parties informally for at least thirty (30)\\ndays.  A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The\\nNotice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.  All offers, promises,\\nconduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and\\nattorneys  are  confidential,  privileged  and  inadmissible  for  any  purpose,  including  impeachment,  in  arbitration  or  any  other  proceeding\\ninvolving  the  parties,  provided  that  evidence  that  is  otherwise  admissible  or  discoverable  shall  not  be  rendered  inadmissible  or  non-\\ndiscoverable as a result of its use in the negotiation.\\n5\\n4857-0921-6260.2\\n8.10\\nSeverability.    If any provision of this arbitration agreement or the application of such provision to any person or\\ncircumstance is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any extent, that provision will, if possible, be construed as though more narrowly\\ndrawn, if a narrower construction would avoid that invalidity, illegality or unenforceability.  If such a narrower construction is not possible,\\nthen that provision will, to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, be severed, and the remainder of this arbitration\\nagreement will not be affected thereby.\\n9.\\nOwnership.\\n9.1\\nConsultant agrees that all inventions, products, designs, drawings, notes, documents, information, documentation,\\nimprovements, works of authorship, processes, techniques, know-how, algorithms, technical and business plans, specifications, hardware,\\ncircuits, computer languages, computer programs, databases, user interfaces, encoding techniques, and other materials or innovations of any\\nkind  that  Consultant  may  make,  conceive,  develop  or  reduce  to  practice,  alone  or  jointly  with  others,  in  connection  with  performing\\nServices or that result from or that are related to such Services, whether or not they are eligible for patent, copyright, mask work, trade\\nsecret, trademark or other legal protection (collectively, “Inventions”), are the sole property of the Company.

Business.\\nOur Mission\\nImprove people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.\\nOverview\\nLyft, Inc (the “Company” or “Lyft”) started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer  marketplace  for on-\\ndemand ridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in\\nthe United States and Canada.\\nWe believe that cities should be built for people, not cars. Mass car ownership in the twentieth century brought unprecedented freedom to individuals and\\nspurred significant economic growth. However, in the process, city infrastructure became overwhelmingly devoted to cars. Roads and parking lots have replaced\\ntoo much green space. Mass car ownership strains our cities and reduces the very freedom that cars once provided. Car ownership has also economically burdened\\nconsumers and can equate to a substantial portion of a household’s transportation spend despite the average car being parked and unused a majority of the time.\\nConsumers are seeking better ways to get around. They have grown accustomed to the convenience and immediacy of the on-demand economy and\\nexpect their experiences to be more simple, flexible and enjoyable. Existing transportation options have failed to meet this shift in consumer demand, creating the\\nopportunity for a better solution.\\nWe believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this\\nmassive societal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “App”) in cities across the United States and\\nin select cities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while\\nproviding  drivers  using  our  platform  the  freedom  and  independence  to  choose  when,  where,  how  long  and  on  what  platforms  they  work.  As  this  evolution\\ncontinues, we believe there is a massive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation\\noptions.\\nWe are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform\\n(the “Lyft Platform”) that powers rides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights\\nfrom a significant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. For example, in May 2020, we\\nexpanded the availability of our Wait & Save mode on our ridesharing platform, which is an ideal offering for riders with more flexible schedules that want to\\nleverage the savings we can offer by shifting demand to better meet supply. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network is well positioned to benefit from\\ntechnological  innovation  in  transportation.  As  just  one  example,  starting  in  2018,  we  were  the  first  company  in  our  industry  to  launch  a  publicly-available\\ncommercial open platform autonomous offering in the United States.\\nToday, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light\\nVehicles”) for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for\\nrenters who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership. We\\nanticipate the demand for our offerings will grow as communities recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and as more and more people discover the convenience,\\nexperience and affordability of using Lyft.\\nWe have made focused and substantial investments in support of our mission. For example, to continually launch new innovations on our platform, we\\nhave invested heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our\\ncommunity, cultivate a differentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled\\nus to create a powerful multimodal platform and scaled user network. For example, in the first quarter of 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, LLC (“Flexdrive”), one of\\nour longstanding partners in the Express Drive program. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements for vehicles that\\nmay  be  used  to  provide  ridesharing  services  on  the  Lyft  Platform.  Flexdrive  will  continue  to  operate  as  an  independent  partner  to  Lyft  and  we  expect  this\\nacquisition to contribute to the growth of our business and help us expand the range of our use cases. We also continue to invest in the expansion of our network of\\nLight  Vehicles  and  autonomous  open  platform  technology.  Our  strategy  is  always  to  be  at  the  forefront  of  transportation  innovation,  and  we  believe  these\\ninvestments will continue to position us as a leader in TaaS. Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we plan to continue to invest in the future, both organically\\nand through acquisitions of complementary businesses.\\nEven as we invest in the business, we remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently. For example, in the second and fourth quarters of 2020,\\nwe undertook restructuring efforts to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges resulting from the COVID-19\\npandemic and its impact on the Company’s business. In addition, we significantly decreased our 2020 capital expenditure spending from our original plan and\\nexceeded our target cost reductions in 2020\\n5\\nby 20%. We also decreased rider incentives to an all-time low in the second quarter of 2020 and maintained them near the historical low through the fourth quarter\\nof 2020, resulting in a significant decrease in sales and marketing expenses.\\nTo advance our mission, we aim to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental\\nresponsibility. We believe that our brand represents freedom at your fingertips: freedom from the stresses of car ownership and freedom to do and see more.\\nThrough our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their\\nincome or zip code. We’ve activated more than 500 nonprofit partners through LyftUp to provide free ride credits to those who need them most, including a focus\\non communities of color. We are also proud to be leaders in the fight against climate change. We’ve made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (“EVs”)\\non the Lyft Platform by 2030. We believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility.\\nOur  values,  brand,  innovation  and  focused  execution  have  put  us  in  a  position  to  emerge  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  even  stronger.  We  remain\\nconfident that demand will return to our platform as we progress through the recovery and as vaccines become more widely available. We continue to believe that\\nusers are increasingly choosing a ridesharing platform based on brand affinity and value alignment.\\nImpact of COVID-19 to our Business\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. The spread of COVID-19 has\\ncaused federal and local health officials to enact precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, restrictions on businesses, extensive\\nsocial distancing measures, and self-quarantine or shelter-in-place guidelines in many regions of the United States and Canada. Beginning in the middle of March\\n2020 and continuing into the first quarter of 2021, the pandemic and these related responses have caused decreased demand for our platform leading to decreased\\nrevenue, decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform, the global slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad\\nvariety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets; and these impacts may continue.\\nFor more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part\\nI.  For  more  information  on  the  impact  of  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  business,  see  the  section  titled  “Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial\\nCondition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II.\\nLyft’s Market Opportunity\\nTransportation is a massive market. Transportation costs are a substantial expenditure for every household, often more than healthcare and entertainment\\nexpenditures. We believe we are still in the very early phases of capturing this massive opportunity as rideshare represents a small percentage of vehicle miles\\ntravelled.  We  also  believe  that  we  have  a  significant  incremental  opportunity  to  address  transportation  spend  by  businesses  and  organizations.  Our  market\\nopportunity today includes transportation spend in the United States and Canada. In the transportation ecosystem, we are one of only two companies that have\\nestablished a TaaS network at scale across the United States.\\nChanges in society and the transportation industry are catalyzing a complete transformation of the massive transportation market:\\n•\\nConsumers increasingly value accessibility and experiences over ownership\\n•\\nRise of on-demand services, specifically within the younger demographic\\n•\\nGreater affinity towards mission-driven brands\\n•\\nIncreased demand for flexible earnings opportunities\\n•\\nEmergence of new modes of transportation, such as our network of shared bikes and scooters\\n•\\nDevelopment of autonomous vehicles\\nThe Lyft Solution\\nOur Transportation Network\\nOur transportation network offers riders seamless, personalized and on-demand access to a variety of mobility options.\\n6\\nOur transportation network is comprised of:\\n•\\nRidesharing Marketplace. Our core offering since 2012 connects drivers with riders who need to get somewhere. The scale of our network enables us to\\npredict  demand  and  proactively  incentivize  drivers  to  be  available  for  rides  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time.  This  allows  us  to  optimize  earning\\nopportunities for drivers and offer convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace\\nconnects drivers with riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada.\\n•\\nExpress Drive. Our flexible car rentals program for drivers who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our\\nrequirements.  Through  our  Express  Drive  program,  drivers  can  enter  into  short-term  rental  agreements  for  vehicles  that  may  be  used  to  provide\\nridesharing services on the Lyft Platform.\\n•\\nLyft Rentals. In 2019, we launched Lyft Rentals to offer an attractive option for users who have long-distance trips, such as a weekend away. This is a\\nseparate consumer offering from Express Drive.\\n•\\nBikes and Scooters. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for options that\\nare more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile\\nand last-mile of a multimodal trip with public transit.\\nLyft bikes are standard and electric pedal-assist bicycles. Lyft has exclusive city partnerships in a majority of locations where we operate a bikeshare\\nprogram including New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Portland and Boston. In 2020, we continued to make inroads with our electric bike fleet\\nwhich is now available across nine markets.\\nUsers can access Lyft scooters via our Lyft App in six major cities in the United States. When in a service area, users can see available scooters nearby.\\nThey can reserve a scooter ahead of time or use the Lyft App to scan the QR code on a nearby scooter to begin a ride.\\n•\\nPublic Transit. Available in select cities, our Transit offering integrates third-party public transit data into the Lyft App to offer users a robust view of\\ntransportation options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is\\nanother  step  toward  providing  effective,  equitable  and  sustainable  transportation  to  our  communities,  and  creating  a  more  seamless  and  connected\\ntransportation network.\\n•\\nAutonomous Vehicles. We have a number of strategic partnerships that offer access to autonomous vehicles. Our Open Platform partnership with Motional\\n(formerly Aptiv) has enabled the commercial deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. We have facilitated over\\n100,000 paid rides in Motional autonomous vehicles with a safety driver since January 2018.\\n7\\nWe have established one of the largest transportation networks in the United States and Canada. While network scale is important, we recognize that\\ntransportation happens locally and each market has its own unique user network. Our dynamic platform adjusts to the specific attributes of each market on a real-\\ntime basis.\\nDrivers\\nThe drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We\\nwork hard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to be their own bosses and providing them the opportunity to focus their time on\\nwhat matters most. Key benefits to drivers on our platform include:\\n•\\nWe offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.\\n•\\nOur predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to drive in order to\\nmaximize their earnings on a real-time basis.\\n•\\nWe procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents while\\non the platform.\\n•\\nTo help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked through the Lyft App.\\nIf  a rider  or  driver  rates the  ride  three stars  or  below,  they will  not  be matched  together  again.  Lyft may  also  follow up with the  parties  to  further\\nunderstand the ride experience and provide additional support if needed.\\n•\\nAll transactions are processed through our platform, so drivers do not need to worry about carrying cash.\\n•\\nOur  Driver  Hubs and  certain  field  locations  in  major  cities  serve  as  gathering  places  and  offer  in-person  support  and  a  personal  connection  to  Lyft\\nemployees. In addition, drivers have access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal\\ngoals.\\n•\\nOn November 3, 2020, California voters passed Proposition 22, which protects independence and flexibility for drivers in California while providing them\\nwith new earnings opportunities and protections, including minimum guaranteed earnings, occupational accident insurance, and contributions towards\\nhealthcare coverage.\\nRiders\\nWe care deeply about the riders on our platform and work to build long-term relationships with them by:\\n•\\ndeveloping simple, elegant and intuitive solutions;\\n•\\nfocusing intensely on the user experience, including soliciting feedback and following up if necessary on the ride experience;\\n•\\nengendering a sense of mutual respect and fair treatment; and\\n•\\npromoting trust and safety within our network.\\nWe believe this approach fuels our word-of-mouth referrals and reinforces our community’s desire to use Lyft over alternatives.\\nRiders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and\\nfrom work, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. For the purposes of “Item 1.\\nBusiness” section, riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile.\\nWe work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation\\nnetwork of choice. Key benefits to riders include:\\n•\\nSelection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Riders enter their destination and are then\\npresented with a range of transportation options to select from based on their needs and preferences. Our proprietary technology efficiently matches riders\\nwith drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. We continuously aim to\\nreduce friction in the booking process with features like “one tap ride” so riders can enter their destinations quickly. Additional modes, such as bikes and\\nscooters, offer riders more options for shorter trips. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized\\nexperiences most suitable to the trip being planned.\\n•\\nAvailability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and\\nriders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. Our machine learning algorithms continuously train our optimization models and dynamically incentivize\\ndrivers to be on our platform when and where riders are seeking\\n8\\ntransportation. We are also expanding our network of shared bikes and scooters. The high availability of our platform and the breadth of our offerings\\nhave made us the preferred transportation network for millions of riders.\\n•\\nAffordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time. For our\\nridesharing marketplace, riders are presented with upfront estimated prices prior to taking the trip so they can anticipate the total cost. We also introduced\\nlower-cost  options  for  riders  to  get  around  in  select  cities,  including  Wait  &  Save  mode,  a  network  of  shared  bikes  and  scooters  and  Transit  with\\naffordability in mind.\\n•\\nSafety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative products,\\npolicies  and  processes.  Before  giving  a  ride  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  all  driver-applicants  are  screened  for  disqualifying  criminal  offenses  and  driving\\nincidents. All approved drivers are also required to complete mandatory Community Safety Education. We conduct monitoring of active Lyft drivers,\\nwhich provides us with continuous and rapid notification of disqualifying criminal records and driving infractions.\\nOur Technology Infrastructure and Operations\\nWe organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design.\\nWe focus on affordability, reliability, efficiency, optimization and cohesion when developing our software. Our offerings are mobile-first and platform agnostic.\\nWe seek to continuously improve the Lyft Platform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks in\\ndemand.\\nWe have a commercial agreement with AWS for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of our partnership, we believe we are\\nmore resilient  to surges in demand on our platform  or product changes we may introduce. Our commercial  agreement  with AWS will remain in effect until\\nterminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after September 30, 2022, and only after complying with certain advance\\nnotice requirements. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to\\nAWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. We committed to spend an aggregate of at least $300 million between January 2019 and June 2022\\non AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the three years. If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any year, we\\nmay be required to pay the difference. We pay AWS monthly, and we may pay more than the minimum purchase commitment to AWS based on usage.\\nWe designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Incremental backups are performed\\nhourly or more frequently and full backups are performed daily. In addition, as a default, redundant copies of content are stored independently in at least two\\nseparate geographic regions and replicated reliably within each region. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our data privacy and security\\nfoundation, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies.\\nOur Intellectual Property\\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets,\\nlicense  agreements,  intellectual  property  assignment  agreements,  confidentiality  procedures,  non-disclosure  agreements  and  employee  non-disclosure  and\\ninvention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe\\nthat factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our\\nsuccess in the marketplace.\\nWe  have  invested  in  a  patent  program  to  identify  and  protect  a  substantial  portion  of  our  strategic  intellectual  property  in  ridesharing,  autonomous\\nvehicle-related technology, telecommunications, networking and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2020, we held 342 issued U.S.\\npatents  and  had  446  U.S.  patent  applications  pending.  We  also  held  59  issued  patents  in  foreign  jurisdictions  and  had  223  applications  pending  in  foreign\\njurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and\\nlogos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks. In\\naddition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.lyft.com and other variations.\\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to\\nprotect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For additional information, see\\nthe  sections  titled  “Risk  Factors—Risks  Related  to  Regulatory  and  Legal  Factors—Claims  by  others  that  we  infringed  their  proprietary  technology  or  other\\nintellectual  property  rights  could  harm  our  business”  and  “Risk  Factors—Risks  Related  to  Regulatory  and  Legal  Factors—Failure  to  protect  or  enforce  our\\nintellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.”\\n9\\nOur Growth Strategy\\nTransportation is a massive market. We are in the very early phase of capturing this large opportunity. Our key growth strategies include our plans to:\\n•\\nIncrease Our Use Cases. We continuously work to extend our offerings to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of\\nuse cases. We offer products to simplify travel decision-making and expand the potential uses for our platform, such as our Lyft Pink subscription plan,\\nLyft Pass commuter  programs, first-mile  and last-mile  services  and university safe rides programs. We also provide centralized  tools and enterprise\\ntransportation solutions tailored to businesses, such as our Concierge offering, which enables organizations to manage the transportation needs of their\\ncustomers, employees and constituents.\\n•\\nRecovery and Growth Of Our Rider Base. We see opportunities to recoup and grow our rider base as the COVID-19 pandemic ends. We intend to make\\nincremental investments in our brand and growth marketing to increase consumer preference as the recovery takes hold. We also may offer discounts for\\nfirst time riders to try Lyft and incentives for existing drivers and riders. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace by attracting\\nand  retaining  drivers  to  our  platform  to  further  improve  the  rider  experience.  Additionally,  we  are  expanding  our  platform  coverage  beyond  the\\ngeographies and markets we currently serve. We also believe we will benefit from demographic trends, such as the growing percentage of the population\\nwho are born as digital natives accustomed to on-demand services.\\n•\\nExpand Our Transportation Offerings. We  continue  to make  Lyft  an  everyday  experience  for  riders  through  our  transportation  network  designed  to\\naddress a wide range of mobility needs. For example, in 2018, we launched a network of shared bikes and scooters, and will continue to supplement and\\nscale modes in order to offer riders more transportation options. In 2019, we added Lyft Rentals to add an attractive option for users planning to travel\\nlonger distances. More recently in 2020, we launched Wait & Save, where riders can opt for a longer wait time but pay a lower fare than for a standard\\nride mode. By expanding our transportation offerings, we can offer riders options that best fit their criteria directly from the Lyft App, which increases\\nrider engagement.\\n•\\nGrow Our Share of Rider Transportation Spend. As we continue to increase rider loyalty to our brand and expand our use cases and the breadth of our\\nmultimodal offerings, we believe we will also increase our share of rider transportation spend. For example, a rider may start using our ridesharing\\noffering for a night out and then choose Lyft again for travel to the airport. Once they have experienced the reliability and convenience of Lyft, they may\\nincorporate Wait & Save into their daily commute, rent one of our shared bikes or scooters for shorter rides or when connecting to public transit, and rent\\none of our Lyft Rentals vehicles for long-distance trips, like a weekend away. We are also investing to increase our share of more valuable rides to grow\\nour share of rider transportation spend. In addition, usage of our platform typically increases over time.\\n•\\nIncrease Value to the Driver Community. We strive to provide the best and most fulfilling economic opportunities for the community of drivers on our\\nplatform. We continuously seek to launch and improve programs and initiatives that enhance the driver experience on our platform. Our Express Drive\\nprogram connects drivers with rental cars and in the first quarter of 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, one of our longstanding partners in the Express Drive\\nprogram. We are also investing in Driver Centers, Mobile Services, and related partnerships that offer affordable and convenient vehicle maintenance to\\nthe driver community. In addition to helping drivers access and maintain vehicles, we are committed to delivering innovative solutions that offer drivers\\nfast and affordable access to their earnings. For example, we were the first ridesharing company to offer instant payouts to drivers through the Lyft App\\nwhen we launched Express Pay in 2015. In 2019, we further improved access to driver earnings by launching Lyft Direct, our no-fee bank account and\\ndebit card for drivers that allows drivers to receive payment instantly after every ride. In 2020, we launched Essential Deliveries, a pilot initiative which\\nprovides  drivers  with  new  earnings  opportunities  by  connecting  them  to  government  agencies,  local  non-profits,  healthcare  organizations,  and  other\\ncompanies that need delivery services for items like food, groceries, prescriptions, medical supplies, home necessities, and auto parts. We believe that our\\nefforts to improve the driver experience allows us to increase driver satisfaction and loyalty to Lyft.\\n•\\nInvest in Technology to Strengthen Our Network and Increase Efficiency. Our investments in proprietary technologies and predictive analytics leverage\\ninsights derived from the rich set of data generated by our platform. These investments allow us to deliver an affordable, convenient and high-quality\\nexperience for riders and increase the earnings of drivers. Our investments in mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies and\\ndata  science  are  key  to  integrating  technology  to  improve  the  safety  and  increase  the  efficiency  of  our  platform.  In  addition,  we  are  investing  in\\nautonomous vehicle-related technology, which we believe will be a critical part of the future of transportation. We recently announced that we were\\nconsidering strategic options for our Level 5 self-driving system development program.\\n•\\nPursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. In November 2018, we acquired Motivate, the largest bike sharing platform in the United States at the time and\\nin  February  2020,  we  acquired  Flexdrive,  one  of  our  longstanding  Express  Drive  partners.  From  time  to  time,  we  have  made  other  acquisitions  of\\nbusinesses and technologies. We will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions that contribute to the growth of our current business, help us expand into\\nadjacent markets or add new capabilities to our platform. We believe drivers and riders on our platform will also benefit from a broader partner ecosystem\\n10\\nthat expands our marketing and loyalty programs and employee ride solutions. We have built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and\\nlocal governments, and technology solutions providers. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and partnerships that contribute to our growth.\\nCompetition\\nThe market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions\\nof new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and\\nenjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our\\ncompetitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nOur main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Canada include Uber and Via. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market\\ninclude Lime and Bird. Our main competitors in the consumer vehicle rental market include Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-\\nshare marketplaces. We also compete with certain non-ridesharing transportation network companies, and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional\\nautomotive manufacturers, such as BMW, which has an ongoing presence in the transportation network market in Europe.\\nAdditionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of\\ncompanies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple, Argo AI,\\nAurora, Baidu and General Motors (Cruise) as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued\\nchallenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.\\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:\\n•\\ncoverage and availability of access and service levels;\\n•\\nscale of network;\\n•\\nchoice of modality;\\n•\\nproduct design;\\n•\\nease of adoption and use;\\n•\\nfeatures and platform experience;\\n•\\npartnerships and integrations with other ecosystem participants;\\n•\\nbrand;\\n•\\ntrust, safety, reliability and privacy;\\n•\\ncustomer support;\\n•\\ncontinued innovation in new modalities;\\n•\\ndriver payout;\\n•\\nregulatory relations;\\n•\\nsustainability; and\\n•\\nprices.\\nWe believe we compete favorably across these factors. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand\\nname recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly\\ngreater resources for the development of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled\\n“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operational Factors—We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.”\\nSeasonality\\nThe revenue we generate from our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays. We\\nexpect the demand for our transportation network may decline over the winter season in certain regions and the demand for our network of shared bikes and\\nscooters may increase during more temperate and dry seasons. Our business is also subject to risks related to COVID-19. In particular, travel bans and restrictions,\\nas well as shelter in place orders have decreased demand and we are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be\\neased, how\\n11\\nriders will respond to the easing of such measures, and whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future, any of which may continue to result\\nin decreased demand notwithstanding usual seasonality.\\nOur Brand and Marketing\\nWe aim to build the defining brand of our generation. We believe that our brand represents freedom at your fingertips: freedom from the stresses of\\ndriving and car ownership, and freedom to do and see more. Our unique values and culture are reflected in our brand. We drive awareness of our brand through our\\nmarketing efforts, which highlight our offerings, the simplicity of our user experience and our commitment to community, and we also benefit from the evangelism\\nby our users.\\nValues and Culture\\nBuilding community and having a positive local impact is fundamental to who we are. We approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities\\nin a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust, respect and a common objective of improving people’s lives by\\nimproving transportation.\\nMillions of people lack access to basic needs because they can’t get a ride. Through our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to make sure everyone has\\naccess to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go — no matter their income or zip code.\\nWe built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most serious outstanding transportation gaps. Through our\\nLyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access to free and discounted car, bike, and\\nscooter rides to individuals and families in need.\\n2020 LyftUp programs included:\\n•\\nGrocery  Access  -  rides  to/from  the  grocery  store  for  families  living  in  areas  without  sufficient  grocery  store  access  and  meal  delivery  to\\nindividuals in need;\\n•\\nJobs Access - rides to/from job interviews, job trainings, and/or the first few weeks of a new job;\\n•\\nVoting Access - rides to the polls;\\n•\\nDisaster Response - rides to access vital services leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies;\\n•\\nMultimodal  Access  -  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter  share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal/state/local\\nassistance programs;\\n•\\nCritical Workforce Programs - providing critical workers including first-responders, healthcare, and transit workforce free scooter rides and free\\nmemberships to bikeshare programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n•\\nUniversal  Vaccine  Access  Campaign  -  mobilizing  a  coalition  of  partners  to  provide  rides  to  and  from  vaccination  sites  for  low-income,\\nunderinsured, and at-risk communities, as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes more widely available; and\\n•\\nCommunity  Grants  Program  -  awards  ride  credits  to  hyperlocal  nonprofit  organizations  across  the  country  making  a  difference  in  their\\ncommunities.\\nAll of this work directly ties back to Lyft’s mission of improving people’s lives with the world\\'s best transportation, and we’re proud to work with\\namazing community partners to bring these programs to life.\\nLastly, Lyft was founded on the belief that technology will enable us to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from the transportation system. We now\\noffer several lower-carbon modes in the Lyft App: bikes, scooters, and transit. In 2019, Lyft launched access to hundreds of EVs on the Lyft Platform through\\nExpress Drive in Seattle, Atlanta, and Denver, and in 2020, Lyft made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles on the Lyft Platform by 2030 and joined\\nThe Climate Group’s EV100 initiative to accelerate the transition to EVs.\\nBrand Marketing\\nOur marketing efforts are designed to educate people about Lyft in creative and memorable ways, generating brand awareness among potential drivers\\nand riders.\\n•\\nLyft-Produced Content. Lyft will produce content and post on various platforms, such as Undercover Lyft where celebrities are disguised as drivers.\\n•\\nPopular Culture. Ad placement in pop culture such as television series and movies.\\n12\\n•\\nMarketing Partnerships. We have marketing partnerships with leading brands, such as J.P. Morgan (Chase), Delta Air Lines, Hilton, and Walt Disney\\nParks & Resorts.\\n•\\nLocal Events. Our goal in sponsoring local events is to boost brand awareness at locally relevant times and use cases.\\n•\\nOutdoor Advertising. To build unaided awareness, we have outdoor billboard campaigns in key markets.\\n•\\nSpecialty Modes. In select markets, riders may experience specialty or promotional ride modes for local events and organizations.\\n•\\nLyft  Amp. Lyft  Amps  are  bright,  oval-shaped  devices  that  sit  on  certain  drivers’  dashboards  which  enhance  the  user  experience,  boost  our  brand\\nawareness, and help promote safety. Amps assist rider identification of their driver’s vehicles and also display a personalized greeting and ETA to inform\\nriders of the estimated time to their destination.\\nPerformance Marketing\\nWe use a variety of channels to drive adoption of our platform and maintain driver and rider loyalty. We use specific channels and initiatives that enable\\nus to measure the impact of our marketing spend. We currently attract new drivers and riders through a variety of marketing channels, including referrals, affiliate\\nprograms,  partnerships,  display  advertising,  radio,  video,  social  media,  email,  search  engine  optimization  and  keyword  search  campaigns.  After  signup,  we\\ncontinue to engage riders through a variety of initiatives, such as emails, in-app notifications and promotions.\\nOur Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform\\nOur robust technology platform powers the millions of rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform in\\nreal-time. We leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets covering\\nthe ride lifecycle, from when drivers go online and riders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the rides. Utilizing\\nmachine learning capabilities to predict future behavior based on many years of historical data and use cases, we employ various levers to balance supply and\\ndemand in the marketplace, creating increased driver earnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data science and algorithms\\nto inform our product development, such as the introduction of Lyft Pink.\\nRidesharing Marketplace Efficiency\\nDuring  the  matching  process,  we  leverage  our  proprietary  dispatch  platform  and  data  to  help  drivers  and  riders  connect  efficiently.  Factors  such  as\\ndistance, destination, route, traffic and travel time contribute to determining both driver to rider matching for our rideshare offerings including our Wait & Save\\nmode, as well as rider-to-rider matching for our shared rides offerings, which is currently paused as a result of COVID-19. Prior to a match, we give drivers a\\nsimple, reliable signal about where to drive and often an incentive to increase earnings. We also focus on providing predictable, competitive and sustainable prices\\nthat optimize value for riders as well as help increase conversion. Our machine learning algorithms continuously train our optimization models and dynamically\\nbalance current and future supply and demand within the marketplace.\\nOptimizing Marketplace Supply\\nOnce drivers sign up and begin driving, our predictive analytics and dynamic pricing algorithms help us to align driver incentives to encourage drivers to\\nbe available, at the right times, in areas of high demand. This helps provide drivers with potentially higher earning opportunities by allowing them to maximize\\ntheir earnings per hour, which can elevate driver satisfaction, increase supply in peak hours and improve the overall efficiency of the marketplace.\\nManaging and Anticipating Rider Demand\\nOur pricing algorithms use real-time ride cost estimates, demand elasticity and data about traffic, weather and other travel conditions to optimize ride\\nprices and balance supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace. This allows us to offer consistently competitive ride prices, reduce rider wait times and\\nmaximize rider utilization of our platform, which we believe leads to long-term driver and rider loyalty.\\nThe Lyft Driver Experience\\nWe help drivers on our platform generate earnings while maintaining a flexible schedule. For these drivers, it all begins with the Lyft Driver App. After\\nextensive background and safety checks, drivers can gain access to our platform and begin driving.\\n•\\nThe Lyft Driver App. Drivers only have to tap ‘Go Online’ in the Lyft Driver App to begin receiving ride requests. Once matched, drivers will get a\\nnotification  to  accept  the  ride  and  receive  the  rider’s  pickup  spot.  On-screen  instructions  and  directions  make  it  easy  to  pick  up  riders,  navigate  to\\ndestinations and drop off riders. Drivers and riders may then rate each other at the end of the ride.\\n13\\n•\\nDriver Dashboard. In the Lyft Driver App, we offer drivers a dashboard that shows the total earnings they can expect to see transferred to their bank\\naccounts.  In  this  dashboard,  we  offer  detailed  views  of  earnings  activity,  ride  count  and  time  spent,  to  help  drivers  understand  and  maximize  their\\nearnings. We provide an in-app Driver Console with additional tools and analytics to help drivers measure ride demand, pinpoint the best times to drive\\neach day, set earnings goals and help them monitor their earnings progress. Drivers also gain real-time visibility into currently available incentives.\\n•\\nLyft Direct. We offer drivers an online bank account and debit card. Drivers with a Lyft Direct debit card get access to their earnings immediately after a\\nride is completed without any transfer or rush fees. In addition, drivers who use the card receive cash back on everyday purchases like gas.\\n•\\nIn-app Tipping. Lyft was the first ridesharing platform to offer In-app Tipping, making it easy for riders to tip right from the app. 100% of tips from\\nriders go to drivers. We built tipping into the Lyft App to encourage great hospitality, and to make it easy for riders to show their appreciation.\\n•\\nDriver Destination Mode. Destination Mode matches drivers with ride requests that get them closer to their intended destination by a specific time. We\\nallow  drivers  to  set  a  targeted  arrival  time  so  they  can  maximize  earnings  until  the  time  they  choose  to  go  offline,  or  we  allow  them  to  specify  a\\ndestination so they only receive priority matched ride requests going in the same direction.\\n•\\nExpress Drive. Express Drive is our flexible car rentals program for drivers. It is designed for those who want to drive using our platform but do not have\\naccess to a vehicle that meets our requirements. Express Drive offers a preferred weekly rate on cars rented from Hertz and Flexdrive. There are cars\\navailable in over 30 cities nationwide through Express Drive and includes EVs in Seattle, Atlanta, and Denver.\\n•\\nDriver  Hubs.  Our  Driver  Hubs  and  service  desks  are  currently  in  40  cities  across  North  America.  These  facilities  are  used  for  driver  onboarding,\\nanswering driver questions and providing free inspections in select markets. They feature access to clean bathrooms and help desks for easy access to the\\nLyft support team.\\n•\\nDriver Centers and Mobile Services. Lyft Driver Centers offer standard maintenance as well as services and repairs including free diagnostic inspection.\\nMobile Services bring auto repairs, including preventative maintenance, directly to the driver.\\n•\\nLyft Rewards. Drivers in over 275 markets are automatically eligible for Lyft Rewards, a driver loyalty program that rewards drivers with features and\\ndiscounts to help them make the most of their time on the road.\\nThe Lyft Rider Experience\\nWe provide a variety of offerings to solve the transportation needs of riders. This starts with the Lyft App, which is a core part of the rider experience. To\\nprovide riders with the best experience, we are also continually adding new features, rider modes and payment models to address the needs of specific groups of\\nriders, such as businesses and government entities.\\nLyft App\\nThe Lyft App provides a variety of ride modes to fit users’ transportation needs. The Lyft App is designed to be fast, simple and purposeful. When a user\\nopens the Lyft App, all ride options available in that location are shown in a unified experience including scooters, bikes, public transit, car rentals, regular rides,\\nlarger vehicle rides, and even more.\\nSubscription Plans\\nOffering subscription plans allows us to provide more earning opportunities for drivers and is an important step toward providing transportation options to\\naddress the range of riders’ budgets and make car ownership optional. Lyft Pink is our subscription program that offers an elevated Lyft experience with preferred\\npricing to enable users to unlock all that their city has to offer. Lyft Pink members receive valuable benefits such as discounts, relaxed cancellations, priority\\nairport pick-ups, access to unlimited, free, in-network food delivery through our partnership with Grubhub+, and more.\\nLyft Business\\nLyft is evolving how businesses large and small take care of their people’s transportation needs across sectors including corporate, healthcare, auto,\\neducation and government. Our comprehensive set of solutions allows customers to design, manage and pay for ground transportation programs that contribute to\\nproductivity and satisfaction while reducing cost, improving transparency and streamlining operations.\\nCorporate Business Travel\\nWe partner with leading travel and expense management companies to deliver seamless experiences that are changing how our customers do business by\\nmaking travel easier for everyone involved. Tools and features such as automated expensing and\\n14\\ncentralized payment improve policy adherence for travelers and offer greater visibility for travel managers. Benefits such as real-time reporting on rides and costs\\nas well as detailed ride data and classification make it easier to attribute, reconcile and reimburse expense spend.\\nConcierge\\nOriginally developed for large healthcare partners to help improve access to quality care, our Concierge offering is now used by organizations of all types\\nto access our network and request or schedule rides for other people. The majority of our ride modes are available through Concierge with features including real-\\ntime ride tracking, 24-hour customer support and the option to request a ride for someone as soon as they are ready or schedule a ride up to a week in advance.\\nOrganizations can also choose to build a seamless transportation experience in their own applications using the Lyft Concierge API.\\nKey benefits of Concierge are:\\n•\\nSimplifying Transportation for Businesses. Concierge  allows organizations  to arrange  rides for  their  customers,  guests  and  patients  from one central\\ndashboard, even if they don’t have the Lyft App or a smartphone. Customers can reduce cost, save time and streamline transportation with our courtesy\\nride tool.\\n•\\nImproving Healthcare. Many Americans miss or delay medical care annually because they cannot get a ride to the doctor. Healthcare transportation\\nbrokers use our Concierge offering to provide patients with a reliable way to get to important healthcare appointments on time.\\nLyft Pass\\nLyft Pass allows organizations to cover the costs of rides for their people - from employees and essential workers, to customers, guests, and more - while\\nprioritizing safety, convenience, and flexibility. Lyft Pass allows organizations to create custom transportation programs that work best for their needs, while\\nstaying in control of budget and how the programs are used. At the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, we partnered with health systems to help essential healthcare\\nworkers on the front lines get to and from work. And today, leading companies are partnering with Lyft to solve their employee’s transportation needs.\\nEnterprise Programs\\nWe offer various enterprise programs, including monthly ride credits for daily commutes, supplementing public transit by providing access to rides for the\\nfirst and last leg of commute trips, late-night rides home and shuttle replacement rides. Companies can provide monthly Lyft credits as a benefit to employees to\\nensure convenient and cost-effective late-night transportation from the office.\\nEvents\\nWe enable transportation solutions that can be customized for events such as recruiting events, conferences, celebrations, meetings and company retreats.\\nOrganizations or individuals can create in-app experiences and custom codes for attendees to ride to and from events.\\nOur Commitment to Safety\\nA strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with\\ndrivers and riders on our platform, and we take significant measures every day that are focused on their safety.\\nTo ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding high quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC\\n(formerly known as Customer Experience and Trust), team as a key part of our organization. With over 400 employees as of December 31, 2020, SCC is in charge\\nof fielding safety and customer support inquiries and is available through multiple channels, including via self-service and assisted support directly within our\\napps. Our SCC team focuses on driving results based on experience-based metrics including First Contact Resolution, which is the number of support tickets\\nresolved during first contact with a driver or rider, and Net Promoter Score. SCC aims to eliminate bad customer experiences, quickly resolve problems when they\\noccur and maintain trust with drivers and riders. This dedication led our customer support to be recently named number one in Newsweek’s 2020 America’s Best\\nCustomer Service rankings for the Taxi and Ridesharing category.\\nThe ways we promote safety include:\\n•\\nCritical Response Line. Our team of specialists within SCC handle sensitive issues regarding behavior or safety incidents on our platform. Available\\n24/7, they work with many teams to provide a high quality of care.\\n•\\nDriving Record and Background Checks. Every driver is screened before they are permitted to drive on our platform, starting with professional third-\\nparty background and driving record checks. To promote a consistently high-quality experience, we ensure vehicles meet our criteria for vehicle age\\nbefore drivers are accepted to drive these vehicles on our platform. We conduct monitoring of active Lyft drivers, which provides us with continuous and\\nexpeditious notification of\\n15\\ndisqualifying criminal records and driving infractions. Any driver who does not meet applicable regulations and our internal safety criteria on both the\\nannual and continuous screenings is barred from our platform.\\n•\\nTwo-Way Ratings. Our two-way ratings system helps promote the safety and comfort of the Lyft community by offering a channel for drivers and riders\\nto provide anonymous feedback on their Lyft experiences through the Lyft App. At the end of each ride, drivers and riders are prompted to rate each other\\non a scale of 1-5 stars. Our ratings system allows drivers and riders to provide anonymous feedback. We take rider ratings and driver feedback very\\nseriously. If a rider rates a driver three stars or fewer, we’ll make sure they aren’t matched together again. If a rider rates a driver four stars or fewer,\\nthey’re required to provide more details about the rating to ensure we’re constantly tracking user feedback. We regularly review community feedback to\\ninform our policies and product features.\\n•\\nZero-Tolerance Policy. Lyft maintains a zero-tolerance drug and alcohol policy for drivers on our platform. We also do not allow riders to have open\\nalcohol containers in-ride and can deactivate riders from the platform for violating this policy.\\n•\\nCommunity Safety Education. All approved drivers are required to complete a mandatory community safety education course.\\n•\\nSafety Features. We continuously invest in new safety features, including increased anti-fraud measures and required feedback for any rides less than\\nfour stars. During the ride, we have designed numerous safety features into the Lyft experience and will continue to innovate to ensure the safety of riders\\nand drivers. Some recently designed safety features include:\\n◦\\nShare Location, which allows riders and drivers to share their location with family and friends;\\n◦\\nEmergency Help, supported by ADT, which allows drivers and riders to quickly and silently connect with an ADT professional, who can alert\\nauthorities if needed;\\n◦\\nSmart Trip Check-In, in some cases, if we notice your ride has stopped too soon or for an unusual amount of time, Lyft will ask drivers and\\nriders if they need support and, if necessary, give the option to request emergency assistance;\\n◦\\nIn-app photos of the driver and vehicle, with license plate numbers and vehicle information;\\n◦\\nReal-time ride tracking, digital receipts; and\\n◦\\nEnhanced identity verification process, which combines driver\\'s license verification and photographic identity verification to prevent identity\\nfraud on our platform.\\n•\\nLyft Insurance Protection. We provide primary liability coverage for TNC drivers from the moment they are matched with a rider until that rider is\\ndropped off. Our auto liability insurance will apply as primary to a driver’s standard personal automobile insurance policy when matched with a rider.\\n•\\nBikes and Scooters. Safety is a key tenet that guides our work with bikes and scooters. We are providing the necessary education and support for all riders\\nand are working with partners to provide the capital and technology solutions to expand protected bike lanes and reduce speeding. We are working with\\norganizations, like Together For Safer Roads and the Vision Zero Network, that collaborate with local bike and pedestrian advocates to help protect our\\ncommunity members. We are also giving away free helmets to select groups of riders in select markets.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues\\nsuch as TNCs, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker\\nconfidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property,\\nconsumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions,\\nterms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency\\nmedical transportation, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and delivery of\\ngoods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many\\ncases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or\\ninterpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\\nThe  TNC  industry  has  also  come  under  increasing  scrutiny  from  non-profit  organizations,  regulators,  and  legislators  for  its  environmental  impact,\\nspecifically  increasing  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  In  2018,  California  passed  first-of-its-kind  legislation  (the  “California  Clean  Miles  Standard  and\\nIncentive Program”) to mandate that TNCs reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis, with additional requirements that TNCs increase the\\npercentage of zero-emission vehicles on their platforms.\\n16\\nPolicymakers  recently  proposed  analogous  legislation  in  Washington  state,  and  other  states  and  the  federal  government  are  actively  observing  the  regulatory\\ndevelopment process for the California Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program.\\nSee the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the subsections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Challenges to\\ncontractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business,” “Risk Factors—\\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to\\ncomply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operational\\nFactors—We rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform, and if we cannot manage\\nour relationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected,”\\n“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of\\npersonal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the\\nprotection or transfer of personal data, could adversely affect our business”, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—We face the risk of\\nlitigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory\\nand Legal Factors—Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and\\nthe risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.\\nHuman Capital\\nOur employees are our human capital and they are our greatest strength and most valuable resource. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,675 employees\\nin approximately 100 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks. Approximately 48% of our employees work in\\nour product management,  engineering,  design and science  organizations.  Our employees  are passionate  about our mission to improve  people’s lives with the\\nworld’s best transportation.\\nWe believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the\\nmore our employees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2020, our employee\\nbase was 62% male and 38% female, and women represented 34% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 47% White, 30% Asian,\\n10% Hispanic or Latinx, 8% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender\\nand ethnicity information is based on self-identification, and employees who did not disclose their gender or ethnicity have been excluded from the applicable\\ndisclosure. As of December 31, 2020, employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 1% of total employees, and employees who did not\\ndisclose ethnicity represented approximately 7% of total U.S. employees.\\nBuilding a more representative workforce requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, develop talent\\ninternally, and open up pathways for advancement. In 2020, we initiated difficult yet necessary conversations to align and inspire our entire organization. We\\neducated our leaders and managers on unconscious bias and practicing empathy, while also encouraging team members to speak openly and honestly about societal\\ninequalities. We launched new initiatives like our revised “Rooney Rule 2.0,” which requires all director level and above roles to consider one woman and one\\nBlack or Latinx candidate at the onsite interview stage, and we have partnered with organizations that support emerging talent in communities of color. We will\\ncontinue to prioritize diversity, inclusion, and representation in the workforce. In December 2020, we released our 2020 Inclusion, Diversity and Racial Equity\\nReport, which is available on our website. We have presented this report annually since 2017 and intend to continue to present this report to make available certain\\ninformation about our diversity and inclusion efforts.\\nNone of our employees are represented by a labor union.

condition  and  results  of\\noperations. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\\nOur business, operations and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, such\\nas  travel  bans,  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders.  The  pandemic  and  these  related  responses  have  caused,  and  are  expected  to  continue  to  cause,\\ndecreased demand for our platform relative to pre-COVID-19 demand, the global slowdown of economic activity (including a decrease in demand for a broad\\nvariety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to\\nthose discussed below:\\n•\\nDeclines in travel as a result COVID-19, including commuting, local travel, and business and leisure travel, has resulted in decreased demand for our\\nplatform which has decreased our revenues. We have also paused our shared rides offerings as a result of COVID-19. During certain periods in the past,\\nthese factors have led to a decrease in earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Changes in travel trends and behavior arising from COVID-19,\\nincluding as a result of new strains of COVID-19, may continue to develop or persist over time and further contribute to this adverse effect.\\n•\\nChanges in driver behavior arising from COVID-19 have led to reduced levels of driver availability on our platform beginning in the second quarter of\\n2020. To the extent that driver availability is limited, our service levels may be negatively impacted, which may adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operation.\\n•\\nIn light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our\\nfinancial and operating results until the pandemic subsides.\\n•\\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business customers have caused a reduction in demand for our Lyft Business offerings and that reduction\\nmay persist or expand further in the future.\\n•\\nThe responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to modify our business practices by having corporate employees in nearly all of our\\nlocations work remotely, limiting employee travel, and cancelling, postponing or holding virtual events and meetings. We may be required to or choose\\nvoluntarily to take additional actions for the health and safety\\n20\\nof our workforce and users of our platform, including after the pandemic subsides and with respect to vaccination, whether in response to government\\norders or based on our own determinations  of what is in the best interests of our employees or users of our platform. The effects of the pandemic,\\nincluding remote working arrangements for employees, may also impact our real estate footprint, financial reporting systems and internal control over\\nfinancial reporting, including our ability to ensure information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\\namended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\\'s rules and forms and that such information is\\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for\\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. To the extent these measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect\\nour ability to timely and accurately report our financial statements or maintain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial\\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n•\\nWe design and contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply\\nof bikes and scooters that meet our standards is critical to our operations. We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network\\nof shared bikes and scooters and we rely on a small number of suppliers for components and manufacturing services. We have faced challenges due to the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic related to these assets, such as delays in their manufacture and delivery, and we may face additional challenges in future periods.\\nThese challenges may adversely affect our ability to deploy new bikes and scooters on our network or to implement new features on our network of\\nshared bikes and scooters. These supply chain issues have and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n•\\nThe impacts of COVID-19 have and may continue to have an adverse impact on the demand for vehicles rented to drivers through our Express Drive\\nprogram, and for our fleet rented to users through Lyft Rentals. Further, COVID-19 has and may continue to negatively impact Lyft\\'s ability to conduct\\nrental operations through the Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals as a result of restrictions on travel, mandated closures, limited staffing availability,\\nand other factors related to COVID-19. For example, in 2020, Lyft Rentals temporarily ceased operations, closing its rental locations, as a result of\\nCOVID-19. Further, while Express Drive rental periods renew on a weekly basis, new rental reservations were temporarily blocked, and subsequently re-\\nopened with modified operations to limit the proximity and amount of interactions between associates and drivers, and to address additional cleaning\\nwhich may be required as a result of COVID-19. These operations are more costly, and vulnerable to shortages of cleaning supplies or other materials\\nrequired to operate rental sites while minimizing the risk of exposure to COVID-19. As a result of the adverse impact to demand for rides on the rideshare\\nplatform, drivers renting from Express Drive have had and may continue to have a diminished ability to pay their rental fees. In response, in 2020,\\nFlexdrive  temporarily  reduced  pricing  for  Flexdrive  rentals  in  cities  most  affected  by  COVID-19,  and  have  waived  rental  fees  for  drivers  who  are\\nconfirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19 or requested to quarantine by a medical professional. Further, Lyft has faced significantly higher costs in\\ntransporting, repossessing, cleaning, and storing unrented and returned vehicles from both fleets. These impacts to the demand for and operations of the\\ndifferent rental programs have and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\\n•\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may delay or prevent us, or our current or prospective partners and suppliers, from being able to develop or deploy autonomous\\nvehicle-related technology, including through direct impacts of the COVID-19 virus on employee and contractor health; shelter-in-place orders by local,\\nstate, or federal governments negatively impacting operations, including our ability to test autonomous vehicle-related technology; impacts to our supply\\nchains or those of our current or prospective partners and suppliers; or economic impacts limiting our or our current or prospective partners or suppliers\\nability to expend resources on developing and deploying autonomous vehicle-related technology. These impacts to the development and deployment of\\nautonomous vehicle-related technology may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n•\\nIn response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we have taken certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs, furloughs and\\nsalary reductions, which may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees. As the severity, magnitude\\nand duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health responses, and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to\\npredict, the pandemic’s impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business\\nstrategies and initiatives, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. As the United States begins to reopen, the recovery of the economy and our business\\nhave fluctuated and vary by geography. Further, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our users, customers, employees, business, operations\\nand financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals’\\nactions that have been and continue  to be taken in response to the pandemic  (including  restrictions  on travel  and transport  and modified  workplace\\nactivities); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response local or regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the speed and efficacy of\\nvaccine distribution; the availability of government funding programs; evolving laws and regulations regarding COVID-19, including those related to\\ndisclosure and notification; general economic uncertainty in key markets and financial market volatility; volatility in our stock price, global economic\\nconditions and levels of economic growth; the\\n21\\nduration of the pandemic; the extent of any virus mutations or new strains of COVID-19; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic\\nsubsides.\\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.\\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile\\nnetworks, the Internet or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay\\nArea, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other epidemics, political crises, such as terrorist\\nattacks, war and other political or social instability, including any instability surrounding the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU (Brexit) and other geopolitical\\ndevelopments, or other catastrophic events, such as the explosion in Nashville on December 25, 2020, whether in the United States or abroad, could adversely\\naffect our operations or the economy as a whole. For example, COVID-19 has led to certain business disruptions as described in our other risk factors, including\\ntravel bans and restrictions, and shelter in place orders that have resulted in declines in demand for our services, as well as adverse effects on drivers and riders on\\nour platform, our suppliers and the economy, all of which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations. The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or our third-party providers’ abilities could result in decreased demand for\\nour offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. All of the\\naforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.\\nOur business and results of operations are also subject to global economic conditions, including any resulting effect on spending by us or riders. If general\\neconomic conditions deteriorate in the United States or in other markets where we operate, discretionary spending may decline and demand for ridesharing may be\\nreduced. An economic downturn resulting in a prolonged recessionary period may have a further adverse effect on our revenue.\\nRisks Related to Operational Factors\\nOur limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\\nWe have been focused on ridesharing since our ridesharing marketplace launched in 2012, and our business continues to evolve. We regularly expand our\\nplatform features, offerings and services and change our pricing methodologies. This relatively limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult\\nto evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks and challenges we have faced or expect to face include our ability to:\\n•\\nforecast our revenue and budget for and manage our expenses;\\n•\\nattract new qualified drivers and new riders and retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders in a cost-effective manner;\\n•\\ncomply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;\\n•\\nmanage our platform and our business assets and expenses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures issued by various\\njurisdictions, including travel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders, as well as maintain demand for and confidence in the safety of our\\nplatform during and following the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n•\\nplan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future offerings, including our network of shared bikes and scooters or certain vehicles in the\\nExpress Drive program and our fleet of vehicles for Lyft Rentals, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future\\nofferings;\\n•\\ndevelop, manufacture, source, deploy, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of shared bikes and scooters, Driver Hubs,\\nDriver Centers and Mobile Services, certain vehicles in the Express Drive program, vehicles for Lyft Rentals, and autonomous vehicle technology;\\n•\\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\\n•\\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\\n•\\neffectively manage our growth and business operations, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business;\\n•\\nsuccessfully expand our geographic reach;\\n•\\nhire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\\n•\\nsuccessfully develop new platform features, offerings and services to enhance the experience of users; and\\n•\\nright-size our real estate portfolio.\\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere\\nin this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical\\nfinancial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a\\nlonger operating history or operated in a\\n22\\nmore predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies\\nwith limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our\\nbusiness, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We incurred net losses\\nof $1.8 billion, $2.6 billion, and $0.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our expenses will likely increase in the future as\\nwe develop and launch new offerings and platform features, expand in existing and new markets and continue to invest in our platform and customer engagement,\\nor as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. For\\nexample, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with the passage of Proposition 22 in California including providing\\ndrivers in California with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards health care coverage, occupational accident insurance and\\nminimum guaranteed earnings, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,\\nincluding sales, marketing and costs relating to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we have expanded over time to include\\nmore asset-intensive offerings such as our network of shared bikes and scooters, autonomous vehicles, Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals. We are also expanding the\\nsupport available to drivers at our Driver Hubs, our driver-centric service centers and community spaces, Driver Centers, our vehicle service centers, Mobile\\nServices  and  through  our  Express  Drive  vehicle  rental  program.  These  offerings  require  significant  capital  investments  and  recurring  costs,  including  debt\\npayments, maintenance, depreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such\\nofferings are otherwise not successful, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the\\nabove, a determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly\\nalter our existing business model and operations (including potentially suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact\\nour ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations,  and  our  ability  to  achieve  or  maintain  profitability  in  the  future.  Additionally,  stock-based  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  units\\n(“RSUs”)  and  other  equity  awards  may  continue  to  be  a  significant  expense  in  future  periods,  and  we  have  $905.6  million  of  unrecognized  stock-based\\ncompensation expense related to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years. Any failure\\nto increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive\\ncash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be\\nable to achieve or maintain profitability.\\nWe face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nThe market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions\\nof new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and\\nenjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our\\ncompetitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nOur main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Canada include Uber and Via. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market\\ninclude Lime and Bird. Our main competitors in the consumer vehicle rental market include Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-\\nshare marketplaces. We also compete with certain non-ridesharing transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional\\nautomotive manufacturers, such as BMW, which has an ongoing presence in the transportation network market in Europe.\\nAdditionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of\\ncompanies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple, Argo AI,\\nAurora, Baidu, and General Motors (Cruise) as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued\\nchallenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.\\nCertain  of  our  competitors  have  greater  financial,  technical,  marketing,  research  and  development,  manufacturing  and  other  resources,  greater  name\\nrecognition, longer operating histories or a larger user base than we do. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of\\nofferings and offer lower prices than we do, which could adversely affect our\\n23\\nresults of operations. Further, they may have greater resources to deploy towards the research, development and commercialization of new technologies, including\\nautonomous vehicle technology or bikes and scooters, or they may have other financial, technical or resource advantages. These factors may allow our competitors\\nto derive greater revenue and profits from their existing user bases, attract and retain qualified drivers and riders at lower costs or respond more quickly to new and\\nemerging  technologies  and  trends.  Our  current  and  potential  competitors  may  also  establish  cooperative  or  strategic  relationships,  or  consolidate,  amongst\\nthemselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources and offerings.\\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\\n•\\nthe popularity, utility, ease of use, performance and reliability of our offerings compared to those of our competitors;\\n•\\nour reputation, including the perceived safety of our platform, and brand strength relative to our competitors;\\n•\\nour pricing models and the prices of our offerings and the fees we charge drivers on our platform;\\n•\\nour  ability,  and  our  ability  compared  to  our  competitors,  to  manage  our  business  and  operations  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  related\\ngovernmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and\\ntransport and modified workplace activities);\\n•\\nour ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders;\\n•\\nour ability, and our ability compared to our competitors, to develop new offerings;\\n•\\nour ability to establish and maintain relationships with partners;\\n•\\nour ability to develop, manufacture, source, deploy, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of shared bikes and scooters,\\nDriver Hubs, Driver Centers and Mobile Services, certain vehicles in the Express Drive program, vehicles for Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle\\ntechnology, including the success of any strategic options we may consider with regard to our assets;\\n•\\nchanges mandated by, or that we elect to make, to address, legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements, judgments, including\\nthose related to the classification of drivers on our platform, injunctions and consent decrees;\\n•\\nour ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees;\\n•\\nour ability to raise additional capital as needed; and\\n•\\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry.\\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur results of operations vary and are unpredictable from period-to-period, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of\\nreasons, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and\\nyear-to-year, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that may cause\\nour results of operations to fluctuate in this “Risk Factors” section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial\\nguidance or other projections, or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\\nThe ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of shared bikes and scooters, are still in relatively early stages of growth\\nand if such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large as we expect, our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\\nPrior to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to\\ngrow, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of shared bikes and scooters, is new\\nand unproven, and it is uncertain whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success will depend\\nto a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely-adopt ridesharing and our other offerings. We cannot be certain whether the COVID-19 pandemic\\nwill continue to negatively impact the willingness of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or the willingness of riders to use shared bikes or scooters. In\\naddition,  we  have  paused  our  shared  rides  offerings,  and  we  were  temporarily  restricted  from  operating  our  bike  share  and  scooter  share  programs  in  one\\njurisdiction due to public health and safety measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently temporarily suspended rentals of\\nscooters due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. If the public does not perceive ridesharing or our other offerings as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt\\nthem  as  a  result  of  concerns  regarding  public  health  or  safety,  affordability  or  for  other  reasons,  whether  as  a  result  of  incidents  on  our  platform  or  on  our\\ncompetitors’ platforms, the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, then the market for our offerings may not further develop, may develop more slowly than we\\nexpect or may not achieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluate the\\n24\\nmarkets in which we operate and the performance of our network of shared bikes and scooters, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue\\noperations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations could be harmed.\\nOur  continued  growth  depends  in  part  on  our  ability  to  cost-effectively  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers  who  satisfy  our  screening  criteria  and\\nprocedures and to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers. To attract and retain qualified drivers, we have, among other things, offered sign-up and\\nreferral bonuses and provided access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. If we do not\\ncontinue to provide drivers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income and other incentive programs, such as volume-based discounts\\nand performance-based bonuses, that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits, we\\nmay fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilization of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or\\nother work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example, beginning in the latter portion of the second quarter of 2020, we saw a\\nshortage of available  drivers relative  to  rider demand in certain  markets  where restrictions  on social  activities  and  visiting  business venues were eased. This\\nimbalance fluctuates for various reasons to the extent that driver availability remains limited, and our revenue may be negatively impacted. In order to improve\\ndriver availability, we may increase incentives available to drivers, which could negatively impact revenue. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22\\nin California, we have begun to provide for drivers to receive the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Our competitors may attempt to compete\\nfor drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, or drivers may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient. Further, other jurisdictions may\\nadopt similar  laws and regulations,  which  we would likely  increase  our expenses. Notwithstanding the passage of Proposition  22, we are subject  to ongoing\\nlitigation in California, including efforts to overturn Proposition 22, and in other jurisdictions. If we are unsuccessful in this ongoing litigation in one or more\\njurisdictions, we may be required to classify drivers as employees rather than independent contractors in those jurisdictions. If this occurs, we will need to develop\\nand implement an employment model that we have not historically used. We may face specific risks relating to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our\\nability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employee drivers to meet rider demand. Similar rulings in\\nother jurisdictions may cause similar effects.\\nIf drivers are unsatisfied with our partners, including our third-party vehicle rental partners, our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy\\nour screening criteria and procedures and to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to\\nattract  drivers  could  fail  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers  or  fail  to  increase  utilization  by  existing  drivers,  or  could  have  other  unintended  adverse\\nconsequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws or background check requirements, may\\nresult in a shift or decrease in the pool of qualified drivers, which may result in increased competition for qualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation\\nand retention. Other factors outside of our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other concerns about personal health and safety, increases in the price of\\ngasoline, vehicles or insurance, or concerns about the availability of government or other assistance programs if drivers continue to drive on our platform, may also\\nreduce the number of drivers on our platform or utilization of our platform by drivers, or impact our ability to onboard new drivers. If we fail to attract qualified\\ndrivers on favorable terms, fail to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers or lose qualified drivers to our competitors, we may not be able to meet\\nthe demand of riders, including maintaining a competitive price of rides to riders, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract new riders, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing riders, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be harmed.\\nOur success depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract new riders, retain existing riders and increase utilization of our platform by current\\nriders. Riders have a wide variety of options for transportation, including personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit and other ridesharing and bike and\\nscooter sharing offerings. Rider preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our rider base, we must appeal to new riders who have historically used\\nother  forms  of  transportation  or  other  ridesharing  or  bike  and  scooter  sharing  platforms.  We  believe  that  our  paid  marketing  initiatives  have  been  critical  in\\npromoting awareness of our offerings, which in turn drives new rider growth and rider utilization. However, our reputation, brand and ability to build trust with\\nexisting and new riders may be adversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our offerings, our policies, including our pricing algorithms,\\ndrivers on our platform, or our competitors, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Further, if existing and new riders do not perceive the\\ntransportation services provided by drivers on our platform to be reliable, safe and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant offerings and features on our\\nplatform, we may not be able to attract or retain riders or to increase their utilization of our platform. As we continue to expand into new geographic areas, we will\\nbe relying in part on referrals from our existing riders to attract new riders, and therefore we must ensure that our existing riders remain satisfied with our offerings.\\nIf we fail to continue to grow our rider base, retain existing riders or increase the overall utilization of our platform by existing riders, we may not be able to\\nprovide  drivers  with  an  adequate  level  of  ride  requests,  and  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be  adversely  affected.  Further,\\ngovernment and private business actions in response to the COVID-19\\n25\\npandemic, such as travel bans, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders, increased reliance on work-from-home rather than working in offices, and people and\\nbusinesses electing to move away from more densely populated cities, have decreased and may continue to decrease utilization of our platform by riders. In\\naddition, if we do not achieve sufficient utilization of our asset-intensive offerings such as our network of shared bikes and scooters and Lyft Rentals vehicles, our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely substantially on our wholly-owned subsidiary and deductibles to insure our auto-related risks and on third-party insurance policies to insure our\\noperations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their obligations,\\nwe may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nFrom the time a driver becomes available to accept rides in the Lyft Driver App until the driver logs off and is no longer available to accept rides, we,\\nthrough our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary and deductibles, often bear substantial financial risk with respect to auto-related incidents, including auto liability,\\nuninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business\\nliabilities up to certain limits. To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related risks, we procure a\\nnumber of third-party insurance policies which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion,\\nwhich  may  change  from  time  to  time,  of  the  auto-related  risk  from  some  third-party  insurance  providers.  In  connection  with  our  reinsurance  and  deductible\\narrangements, we deposit funds into trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which some third-party insurance providers are reimbursed for\\nclaims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. If we fail to\\ncomply with state insurance regulatory requirements or other regulations governing insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations\\ncould be adversely affected. If any of our third-party insurance providers or administrators who handle the claim on behalf of the third-party insurance providers\\nbecome insolvent, they could be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make.\\nWe also procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including employment practices liability, workers’ compensation,\\nbusiness interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability and general business liabilities, including product liability. For\\ncertain types of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, such as a scaled network of autonomous vehicles, we may not be\\nable to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks\\nrelated  to  our  new  and  evolving  offerings,  and  we  may  have  to  pay  high  premiums,  self-insured  retentions  or  deductibles  for  the  coverage  we  do  obtain.\\nAdditionally, if any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it could be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Certain losses may be\\nexcluded from insurance coverage including, but not limited to losses caused by intentional act, pollution, contamination, virus, bacteria, terrorism, war and civil\\nunrest.\\nThe amount of one or more auto-related claims or operations-related claims has exceeded and could continue to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage\\nlimits,  for  which  we  have  borne  and  could  continue  to  bear  the  excess,  in  addition  to  amounts  already  incurred  in  connection  with  deductibles,  self-insured\\nretentions or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many types of claims, coverages and for a\\nvariety of commercial risk and are likely to do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we may decide to raise our\\ndeductibles  or self-insured  retentions  when our policies  are renewed or replaced  to manage  pricing  pressure.  Our business, financial  condition  and results  of\\noperations could be adversely affected if (i) cost per claim, premiums or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience (ii) we experience a\\nclaim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not\\nprovided, (v) the number of claims and average claim cost under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historic averages or (vi) an insurance policy\\nis cancelled or non-renewed.\\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses, and we\\nperiodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions and insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We\\nemploy various predictive modeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry statistics to\\nestimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective\\nand speculative. While an independent actuary firm periodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness and provides claims reserve valuations, a number of\\nexternal factors can affect the actual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open, fluctuations in\\nhealthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such factors can impact\\nthe reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves for claims incurred but not yet reported and any\\nrelated estimable expenses for current and historical periods. Additionally, we have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, instances of insurance\\nfraud, which could increase our actual insurance-related costs. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate,\\nindividually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial\\n26\\nstatements. If we determine that our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination,\\nwhich could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our financial condition and results of\\noperations. For example, the adverse development to insurance reserves we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020 was largely attributable to historical auto\\nlosses that are associated with accident liabilities from the end of 2018 and 2019.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers for our auto-related insurance claims, and if such providers fail to service insurance\\nclaims  to  our  expectations  or  we  do  not  maintain  business  relationships  with  them,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be\\nadversely affected.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers to service our auto-related claims. If any of our third-party insurance service\\nproviders fails to service claims to our expectations, discontinues or increases the cost of coverage or changes the terms of such coverage in a manner not favorable\\nto drivers or to us, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage or services on reasonable terms in an acceptable time frame or at all.\\nIf we cannot find alternate third-party insurance service providers on terms acceptable to us, we may incur additional expenses related to servicing such auto-\\nrelated claims using internal resources.\\nWe may, from time to time, explore the possibility of selling portions of retained insurance risk to third-parties. This may cause us to incur additional\\nexpenses in the total cost of this risk. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we entered into a Novation Agreement to transfer nearly all of our primary\\nauto insurance liabilities related to periods preceding October 2018 to a third-party and in October 2020, we expanded our rideshare insurance program to include\\nadditional third-party insurance-service providers.\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party insurance service providers could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially\\nlead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur reputation, brand and the network effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are important to our success, and if we are not able to maintain\\nand continue developing our reputation, brand and network effects, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand as a safe, reliable and affordable platform and continuing to increase the strength of the network\\neffects among the drivers and riders on our platform are critical to our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders. The successful development of our\\nreputation, brand and network effects will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Negative perception of our platform or company\\nmay harm our reputation, brand and networks effects, including as a result of:\\n•\\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, drivers on our platform, riders, our product offerings or our policies and guidelines, including our practices and\\npolicies with respect to drivers, or the ridesharing industry, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents;\\n•\\nillegal, negligent, reckless or otherwise inappropriate behavior by drivers or riders or third parties;\\n•\\na failure to provide drivers with a sufficient level of ride requests, charge drivers competitive fees and commissions or provide drivers with competitive\\nfares and incentives;\\n•\\na failure to offer riders competitive ride pricing and pick-up times;\\n•\\na failure to provide a range of ride types sought by riders;\\n•\\nconcerns by riders or drivers about the safety of ridesharing and our platform in light of the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n•\\nactual or perceived disruptions or defects in our platform, such as privacy or data security breaches, site outages, payment disruptions or other incidents\\nthat impact the reliability of our offerings;\\n•\\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform or our business;\\n•\\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\\n•\\nchanges  to  our  policies  that  users  or  others  perceive  as  overly  restrictive,  unclear  or  inconsistent  with  our  values  or  mission  or  that  are  not  clearly\\narticulated;\\n•\\na failure to detect a defect in our autonomous vehicles or our bikes or scooters;\\n•\\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair and transparent;\\n•\\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our stated values and mission;\\n•\\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support service experiences;\\n•\\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\\n•\\nnegative responses by drivers or riders to new offerings on our platform;\\n27\\n•\\naccidents, defects or other negative incidents involving autonomous vehicles or bikes and scooters on our platform;\\n•\\nperception of our treatment of employees and our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\\n•\\nmodification or discontinuation of our community or sustainability programs;\\n•\\npolitical or social policies or activities; or\\n•\\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects the public’s perception of us or our industry\\nas a whole.\\nIf we do not successfully maintain and develop our brand, reputation and network effects and successfully differentiate our offerings from competitive\\nofferings, our business may not grow, we may not be able to compete effectively and we could lose existing qualified drivers or existing riders or fail to attract new\\nqualified drivers or new riders, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes we may make\\nto enhance and improve our offerings and balance the needs and interests of the drivers and riders on our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s\\nperspective (such as riders) but negatively from another’s perspective (such as drivers), or may not be viewed positively by either drivers or riders. If we fail to\\nbalance the interests of drivers and riders or make changes that they view negatively, drivers and riders may stop using our platform, take fewer rides or use\\nalternative platforms, any of which could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIllegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activity of users, whether or not occurring while utilizing our platform, could expose us to liability and harm our\\nbusiness, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIllegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities by users, including the activities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not\\nthen receiving or providing services offered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating users of our platform could adversely affect\\nour brand, business, financial condition and results of operations. These activities may include assault, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank\\naccounts, sharing of rider or driver accounts and other misconduct. While we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify and address the\\nrisk of these types of activities, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activity by these parties from\\noccurring in connection with our offerings. Such conduct could expose us to liability or adversely affect our brand or reputation. At the same time, if the measures\\nwe have taken to guard against these illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all drivers undergo annual background\\nchecks or our two-way rating system and related policies, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent qualified drivers and riders otherwise in good standing from\\nusing our offerings, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the growth\\nand retention of the number of qualified drivers and riders on our platform and their utilization of our platform could be negatively impacted. Further, any negative\\npublicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our platform, on our competitors’ platforms, or on any ridesharing platform, could adversely\\naffect our reputation and brand or public perception of the ridesharing industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and\\npotentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential and existing drivers, and if such providers fail to provide accurate information, or if\\nproviders are unable to complete background checks because of court closures or other unforeseen government shutdown, or we do not maintain business\\nrelationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen the records of potential and existing drivers to help identify those that are not qualified to\\nutilize our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards. Our business has and may continue to be adversely affected to the extent we cannot attract\\nor  retain  qualified  drivers  as  a  result  of  such  providers  being  unable  to  complete  certain  background  checks  because  of  court  closures  or  other  government\\nshutdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic, or to the extent that they do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations or the requirements of applicable\\nlaw  or  regulations.  If  any  of  our  third-party  background  check  providers  terminates  its  relationship  with  us  or  refuses  to  renew  its  agreement  with  us  on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable\\ntime frame. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential drivers,\\nand as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers\\ndo not meet our expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, unqualified drivers may be permitted to provide rides on our platform, and\\nas a result, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing drivers on our platform. If we or\\ndrivers on our platform fail to comply with applicable laws, rules and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected.\\n28\\nAny  negative  publicity  related  to  any  of  our  third-party  background  check  providers,  including  publicity  related  to  safety  incidents  or  data  security\\nbreaches, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChanges to our pricing could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.\\nDemand for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven and incentives paid to drivers and the fees we\\ncharge  drivers.  Many  factors,  including  operating  costs,  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  or  constraints  and  our  current  and  future  competitors’  pricing  and\\nmarketing strategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of\\nofferings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than us. This\\nincludes the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. In the past, we have\\nmade pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and there can be no assurance that we will not be forced,\\nthrough competition, regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we\\ncharge the drivers on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive\\npressures.  Furthermore,  the  economic  sensitivity  of  drivers  and  riders  on  our  platform  may  vary  by  geographic  location,  and  as  we  expand,  our  pricing\\nmethodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could\\namplify these effects. For example, state and local laws and regulations regarding pricing during the COVID-19 pandemic have imposed limits on prices for certain\\nrides  and  certain  local  regulations  regarding  minimum  earnings  standards  for  drivers  have  caused  us  to  revise  our  pricing  methodology  in  certain  markets,\\nincluding New York City and Seattle. We have launched, and may in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription packages and\\ndriver or rider loyalty programs. We have also modified, and may in the future modify, existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy. Any of\\nthe foregoing actions may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and riders.\\nWhile we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may\\nultimately be unsuccessful. A determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver\\nutilizing a ridesharing platform as an employee, may require us to revise our pricing methodologies to account for such a change to driver classification. The recent\\npassage of Proposition 22 in California will enable us to provide additional earning opportunities to drivers in California, including guaranteed earnings. We expect\\nthat this transition will continue to require additional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including potential\\nchanges to our pricing. We have also launched, and may in the future launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for drivers on our platform, which may\\nnot ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers. Moreover, successful litigation to overturn Proposition 22, or the reclassification of drivers\\non our platform as employees could reduce the available supply of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment\\nmodel. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices and balance supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate\\nor there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we could be underpricing or overpricing our offerings. In addition, if the offerings on our platform\\nchange, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. As we continue to launch new and develop existing asset-intensive offerings such as our network of\\nshared bikes and scooters, autonomous vehicles, Driver Hubs, Driver Centers and Mobile Services, Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals, factors such as\\nmaintenance, debt service, depreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect our pricing methodologies. Any such changes to our\\npricing methodologies or our ability to efficiently price our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we are unable to efficiently grow and further develop our network of shared bikes and scooters, which may not grow as we expect or become profitable over\\ntime, and manage the related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWhile some major cities have widely adopted bike and scooter sharing, there can be no assurance that new markets we enter will accept, or existing\\nmarkets will continue to accept, bike and scooter sharing, and even if they do, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our related offerings\\nwill be successful in such markets. For example, in May 2019 the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (“SFMTA”) opened a public permit application\\nprocess for bike share operators in violation of our exclusive right to operate a bike share program in San Francisco’s public rights-of-way. In June 2019, we filed\\nan action for injunctive and declaratory relief through one of our subsidiaries to protect its negotiated right to exclusivity for a bike share program and, in July\\n2019, the court granted a preliminary injunction preventing the SFMTA from issuing any permits in violation of those exclusive rights. While we entered into a\\nsettlement  agreement  with  SFMTA in  January  2021  pursuant  to  which  we settled  this  litigation  and  SFMTA agreed  not  to  issue  permits  to  other  bike  share\\noperators in violation of our exclusive rights, other jurisdictions in which we currently hold, or may in the future hold, exclusive rights to operate could follow suit\\nin issuing permits in violation of such exclusive rights or in making a determination that we do not hold exclusive rights to operate. A negative determination in\\nother legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, could adversely affect our\\ncompetitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted from operating\\ndue to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in\\n29\\ncertain jurisdictions. For example, the city of Miami suspended rentals of bikes and scooters from March through October 2020 as a result of the COVID-19\\npandemic and again suspended rentals of scooters from December 2020 through February 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. While we do\\nnot expect any denial or suspension in an individual region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our\\nbusiness and results of operations. Even if we are able to successfully develop and implement our network of shared bikes and scooters, there may be heightened\\npublic skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there could be negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the\\noverall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving an increased number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general\\nsafety of the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidents on our platform or incidents involving our competitors’\\nofferings.\\nWe design and contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply\\nof bikes and scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be no\\nassurance we will be able to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable basis, at a\\nreasonable price or at all. We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of shared bikes and scooters and we rely on a small\\nnumber of suppliers for components and manufacturing services.\\nThe supply chain for our bikes and scooters exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or shortages. In the event that our supply of bikes\\nand scooters or key components is interrupted or there are significant increases in prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected. Changes in business conditions, force majeure, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental or regulatory changes\\nand other factors beyond our control have and could continue to affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver products on a timely basis. For example, as a result of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, some of our suppliers have been delayed in delivering products, which has resulted in our later than anticipated deployment of products to\\nthe market in some cases.\\nWe incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing and operations of our network of shared bikes and scooters and we expect to continue\\nincurring such costs as we expand our network of shared bikes and scooters. The prices and availability of bikes and scooters and related products may fluctuate\\ndepending on factors beyond our control including market and economic conditions, tariffs, changes to import or export regulations and demand. Substantial\\nincreases in prices of these assets or the cost of our operations would increase our costs and reduce our margins, which could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  Further,  customs  authorities  may  challenge  or  disagree  with  our  classification,  valuation  or  country  of  origin\\ndeterminations of our imports. Such challenges could result in tariff liabilities, including tariffs on past imports, as well as penalties and interest. Although we have\\nreserved for potential payments of possible tariff liabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be\\nharmed.\\nOur bikes and scooters or components thereof, including bikes and scooters and components that we design and contract to manufacture using third-party\\nsuppliers, may experience quality problems, defects or acts of vandalism or theft from time to time, which could result in decreased usage of our network of shared\\nbikes and scooters or loss of our bikes or scooters. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all defects, vandalism or theft of our bikes and\\nscooters. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, litigation or regulatory challenges, including personal injury or products liability claims, and harm to our\\nreputation.\\nThe revenue we generate from our network of shared bikes and scooters may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to, among other things, seasonal factors\\nincluding weather. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to assess the exact nature or extent of the effects of seasonality on our network of shared\\nbikes and scooters, however, we expect the demand for our bike and scooter rentals to decline over the winter season and increase during more temperate and dry\\nseasons. Our network of shared bikes and scooters is also subject to risks related to COVID-19, as discussed above. In particular, travel bans and restrictions, as\\nwell as shelter in place orders have decreased demand and we are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be eased,\\nhow riders of shared bikes and scooters will respond to the easing of such measures, and whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future,\\nany of which may continue to result in decreased demand notwithstanding usual seasonality. Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluate the markets in\\nwhich we operate and the performance of our network of shared bikes and scooters, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in\\ncertain markets as a result of such evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nIf we are unable to efficiently develop our own autonomous vehicle technologies or develop partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle\\ntechnologies on our platform in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe  partner  with  several  companies  to  develop  autonomous  vehicle  technology  and  offerings,  including,  at  times,  the  development  of  jointly-owned\\nintellectual property, and we continue to devote resources towards developing our own autonomous vehicle technology for use on our platforms. Autonomous\\ndriving is a new and evolving market, which makes it difficult to predict its acceptance, its growth, and the magnitude and timing of necessary investments and\\nother trends, including when it may be more broadly or commercially available. Our initiatives may not perform as expected, which would reduce the return on our\\ninvestments in\\n30\\nthis area, and our partners may decide to terminate their partnerships with us. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely delay or prevent us, or our\\ncurrent or prospective partners and suppliers, from being able to develop or deploy autonomous vehicle technology. We recently announced that we were exploring\\nstrategic options for our Level 5 self-driving system development program. If we are unable to efficiently develop our own autonomous vehicle technology or to\\ndevelop and maintain partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technology on our platform, if we do so at a slower pace or at a higher cost or\\nif  our  technology  is  less  capable  relative  to  our  competitors,  or  if  our  efforts  to  optimize  our  strategy  with  regard  to  our  autonomous  vehicle  technology\\ndevelopment are not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nThe autonomous vehicle industry may not continue to develop, or autonomous vehicles may not be adopted by the market, which could adversely affect our\\nprospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology for use on our platforms. Autonomous\\ndriving involves a complex set of technologies, including the continued development of sensing, computing and control technology. We rely both on our own\\nresearch and development and on strategic partnerships with third-party developers of such technologies, as such technologies are costly and in varying stages of\\nmaturity.  There  is  no  assurance  that  this  research  and  development  or  these  partnerships  will  result  in  the  development  of  market-viable  technologies  or\\ncommercial success in a timely manner or at all. In order to gain acceptance, the reliability of autonomous vehicle technology must continue to advance.\\nAdditional challenges to the development and deployment of autonomous vehicle technology, all of which are outside of our control, include:\\n•\\nmarket acceptance of autonomous vehicles;\\n•\\nstate, federal or municipal licensing requirements and other regulatory measures;\\n•\\nnecessary changes to infrastructure to enable adoption;\\n•\\nconcerns regarding electronic security and privacy; and\\n•\\npublic perception regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles for drivers, riders, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road.\\nThere are a number of existing laws, regulations and standards that may apply to autonomous vehicle technology, including vehicle standards that were\\nnot originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly evolve, which may increase the likelihood of\\ncomplex, conflicting or otherwise inconsistent regulations, which may delay our ability to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market or significantly increase\\nthe compliance costs associated with this business strategy. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market will accept autonomous vehicles or the timing of\\nsuch acceptance, if at all, and even if it does, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our offerings will be successful in the market. Even if\\nwe are able to successfully develop and implement autonomous vehicle technology, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent technology and its\\nadopters. In particular, there could be negative public perception surrounding autonomous vehicles, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries or\\ndeath  occurring  as  a  result  of  accidents  involving  autonomous  vehicles  and  the  potential  loss  of  income  to  human  drivers  resulting  from  widespread  market\\nadoption  of  autonomous  vehicles.  Such  negative  public  perception  may  result  from  incidents  on  our  platform  or  incidents  on  our  partners’  or  competitors’\\nplatforms. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe could be subject to claims from riders, drivers or third parties that are harmed whether or not our platform is in use, which could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to injuries to, or deaths of, riders, drivers or third-parties\\nthat are attributed to us through our offerings. We may also be subject to claims alleging that we are directly or vicariously liable for the acts of the drivers on our\\nplatform or for harm related to the actions of drivers, riders, or third parties, or the management and safety of our platform and our assets, including in light of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures issued by various jurisdictions, including travel bans, restrictions, social distancing guidance, and shelter-\\nin-place orders. We may also be subject to personal injury claims whether or not such injury actually occurred as a result of activity on our platform. For example,\\nthird parties have in the past asserted legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to the actions of a driver or rider who may have previously\\nutilized our platform, but was not at the time of such injury. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes choose to settle for\\nreasons including expediency, protection of our reputation and to prevent the uncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as\\nour business grows and we face increasing public scrutiny. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any riders, drivers or\\nthird parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance policies and\\nprograms may not provide sufficient coverage to adequately mitigate the potential liability we face, especially where any one incident, or a group of incidents,\\ncould cause disproportionate harm, and we may have to pay high premiums or deductibles for our coverage and, for certain situations, we may not be able to secure\\ncoverage at all.\\nAs we expand our network of shared bikes and scooters, we may be subject to an increasing number of claims, lawsuits, investigations or other legal\\nproceedings related to injuries to, or deaths of, riders of our bikes and scooters, including potential\\n31\\nindemnification claims. In some cases, we could be required to indemnify governmental entities for claims arising out of issues, including issues that may be\\noutside of our control, such as the condition of the public right of way. Any such claims arising from the use of our bikes and scooters, regardless of merit or\\noutcome, could lead to negative publicity, harm to our reputation and brand, significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure or decreased use of our bikes and\\nscooters.  Further,  the  bikes  and  scooters  we  design  and  contract  to  manufacture  using  third-party  suppliers  and  manufacturers,  including  certain  assets  and\\ncomponents we design and have manufactured for us, could contain design or manufacturing defects, which could also lead to injuries or death to riders. There can\\nbe no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all defects, and failure to do so could harm our reputation and brand or result in personal injury or\\nproducts liability claims or regulatory proceedings. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur bikes and scooters may experience quality problems from time to time, which could result in product recalls and removal from service, injuries, litigation,\\nenforcement actions and regulatory proceedings, and could adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe design, contract to design and manufacture, and directly and indirectly modify, maintain and repair, bikes and scooters for our network of shared\\nbikes and scooters. Such bikes and scooters may contain defects in their design, materials and construction, may be improperly maintained or repaired or may be\\nsubject to vandalism. These defects, improper maintenance or repair or vandalism have in the past unexpectedly interfered, and could in the future unexpectedly\\ninterfere, with the intended operations of the bikes or scooters, and have resulted, and could in the future result, in other safety concerns, including alleged injuries\\nto riders or third parties. Although we, our contract manufacturers and our third-party service providers test our bikes and scooters before they are deployed onto\\nour network, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect or prevent all defects.\\nFailure to detect, prevent or fix defects and vandalism, or to properly maintain or repair our bikes and scooters could result in a variety of consequences\\nincluding product recalls and removal from service, service interruptions, injuries, litigation, enforcement actions and regulatory proceedings. The occurrence of\\nreal or perceived quality problems or material defects in our current or future bikes and scooters could result in negative publicity, service interruptions, regulatory\\nproceedings, enforcement actions or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if riders or third parties are injured. Even if injuries to riders or third parties are not the\\nresult of any defects in, vandalism of, or the failure to properly maintain or repair our bikes or scooters, we may incur expenses to defend or settle any claims or\\nrespond to regulatory inquiries, and our brand and reputation may be harmed. Any of the foregoing risks could also result in decreased usage of our network of\\nshared bikes and scooters and adversely affect our business, brand, financial conditions and results of operations.\\nOur revenue growth rate and financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance and such revenue growth rate or growth in\\ndemand for our offerings may slow over time.\\nPrior  to  COVID-19,  we  grew  rapidly.  In  2020,  due  to  COVID-19  and  the  related  government  and  public  health  measures,  our  revenue  declined\\nsignificantly. Accordingly, our recent revenue growth rate and financial performance, both prior to the effects of COVID-19, and the decline related to COVID-19,\\nshould not be considered indicative of our future performance. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenue was $2.4 billion, $3.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively,\\nrepresenting a 35% decrease in rate from 2019 to 2020 and a 68% growth rate from 2018 to 2019. We have experienced a decline in revenue in 2020 due to\\ndecreased demand for our ridesharing platform in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect that our revenue growth rate and financial performance in\\nfuture quarters will continue to be harmed. You should not rely on our revenue for any previous quarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue or\\nrevenue growth in future periods. As our business recovers from the effects of COVID-19 and we endeavor to return to growth, our revenue growth rates will\\nfluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, slowing demand for our offerings,\\nincreasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or market saturation, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our\\nbusiness model and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities.\\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nSince 2012, we have generally experienced rapid growth in our business, the number of users on our platform and our geographic reach, and we expect to\\ncontinue to experience growth in the future. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and\\nfinancial  infrastructure.  Employee  growth  has  occurred  both  at  our  San  Francisco  headquarters  and  in  a  number  of  our  offices  across  the  United  States  and\\ninternationally. The number of our full-time employees increased from 2,708 as of December 31, 2017, to 4,675 as of December 31, 2020. However, in the second\\nquarter of 2020, we implemented a plan of termination to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges resulting\\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, which plan involved the termination of approximately 17% of our employees. Steps we take to\\nmanage our business operations, including remote work policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies for future growth may adversely\\naffect our reputation and brand, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel.\\nOur ability to manage our growth and business operations effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing\\nbusiness will require us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue\\n32\\nto  retain,  attract,  train,  motivate  and  manage  employees.  Continued  growth  could  strain  our  ability  to  develop  and  improve  our  operational,  financial  and\\nmanagement controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally,\\nif we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our offerings could suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation\\nand brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAny actual  or perceived  security  or  privacy  breach  could  interrupt  our operations,  harm our  brand and  adversely  affect  our reputation,  brand, business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of our users’ personal data and other sensitive data. An increasing number of\\norganizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions and government institutions, have\\ndisclosed breaches of their information security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted\\nattacks. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and may not be known until launched\\nagainst us, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to our\\nsystems or facilities through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of our service providers, partners or users\\non our platform, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, service providers, partners, users or others into disclosing rider names, passwords, payment\\ncard information or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems, or attempting to fraudulently induce our\\nemployees, partners or others into manipulating payment information, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to criminal actors. In addition, users on our\\nplatform could have vulnerabilities on their own mobile devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platform, but could mistakenly attribute their own\\nvulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches experienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are becoming\\nincreasingly common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be state-\\nsponsored or supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect.\\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our users’ data, prevent data loss and prevent other security breaches,\\nthese security measures cannot guarantee total security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and\\nthird parties may be able to access our users’ personal information and payment card data that are accessible through those systems. Additionally, as we expand our\\noperations,  including  having  employees  or  third-party  relationships  in  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States,  or  expand  work-from-home  practices  of  our\\nemployees (including increased use of video conferencing), our exposure to cyberattacks or security breaches may increase. Further, employee error, malfeasance\\nor other errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in an actual or perceived privacy or security breach or other security incident.\\nAlthough we have policies restricting the access to the personal information we store, our employees have been accused in the past of violating these policies and\\nwe may be subject to these types of accusations in the future.\\nAny actual or perceived breach of privacy or security could interrupt our operations, result in our platform being unavailable, result in loss or improper\\ndisclosure of data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships with third-party partners, result in significant\\nlegal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of driver or rider confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Any breach of privacy or security impacting any entities with which we share or disclose data (including, for\\nexample, our third-party technology providers) could have similar effects. In addition, any actual or perceived breach of security in any autonomous vehicles,\\nwhether  ours  or  our  competitors’,  could  result  in  legal,  regulatory  and  financial  exposure  and  lead  to  loss  of  rider  confidence  in  our  platform,  which  could\\nsignificantly undermine our business strategy. Further, any cyberattacks or security and privacy breaches directed at our competitors could reduce confidence in the\\nridesharing industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce confidence in us.\\nAdditionally,  defending  against  claims  or  litigation  based  on  any  security  breach  or  incident,  regardless  of  their  merit,  could  be  costly  and  divert\\nmanagement’s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that\\ninsurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The\\nsuccessful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,\\nincluding premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our offerings to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon\\nWeb Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations using Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services.\\nWe do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters,\\ncybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical\\nto our success. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience, interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to\\ntime due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. In\\n33\\naddition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted\\nperformance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to\\nmaintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising\\nfrom these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our offerings.\\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after\\nSeptember 30, 2022, and only after complying with certain advance notice requirements. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the\\nagreement or for failure to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement\\nwith AWS is terminated or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the\\ntransfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the\\navailability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant short term loss of revenue, increase our costs and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which\\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIn January 2019, we entered into an addendum to our commercial agreement with AWS, pursuant to which we committed to spend an aggregate of at\\nleast $300 million between January 2019 and December 2021 on AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the three years. In May 2020,\\nwe amended the addendum to extend the commitment period through June 2022 with no change to the aggregate commitment amounts. If we fail to meet the\\nminimum purchase commitment during any year, we may be required to pay the difference, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nWe rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners for our Express Drive program as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance\\npartners to support our Express Drive Program and Lyft Rentals Program, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such parties and other risks related\\nto our Express Drive and Lyft Rentals program, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners to supply vehicles\\nto drivers for our Express Drive program. If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners\\nterminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, the availability of vehicles for drivers in certain\\nmarkets could be adversely impacted, and we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an\\nacceptable time frame. Similarly, in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a\\nresult of public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting vehicles in these partners’ fleets, the supply of vehicles available from these partners\\ncould become constrained. For example, in September 2019, GM issued a recall affecting the 2018 Chevy Malibu, which affected a moderate portion of the fleet\\nprovided by Lyft’s rental partners. In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which may affect their ability to meet the requirements of our\\nExpress Drive program. If we cannot find alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners’ or Lyft’s fleets are impacted by\\nevents such as vehicle recalls, we may not be able to meet the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive\\nto qualified drivers and consumers. In addition, due to a number of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-related insurance\\nprogram, we incur an incrementally higher insurance cost from our Express Drive program compared to the corresponding cost from the rest of our ridesharing\\nmarketplace offerings. In the first quarter of 2020, Lyft acquired one of the rental partners in the Express Drive program, Flexdrive, as a wholly-owned subsidiary\\nof Lyft. While wholly-owned by Lyft, Flexdrive will continue operating as an independent company, maintaining its own governance, management, personnel and\\nassets, including its fleet. If Lyft and Flexdrive are unable to manage costs of operating Flexdrive’s fleet and potential shortfalls between such costs and the rental\\nfees collected from drivers, we may update the pricing methodologies related to Flexdrive’s offering in Lyft’s Express Drive program which could increase prices,\\nand in turn adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers.\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners, including publicity related to quality standards or safety\\nconcerns, could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur Express Drive and Lyft Rentals programs expose us to certain risks, including with respect to decreases in the residual value related to the used car\\nmarket values, or reductions in the utilization, of vehicles in the fleet.\\nFor  the  Lyft  Rentals  consumer  car  rental  business  and,  through  our  subsidiary  Flexdrive,  for  vehicles  rented  to  drivers  through  our  Express  Drive\\nprogram, we source a portion of the fleet from a range of auto manufacturers. To the extent that any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production,\\nincrease the cost of purchasing cars or decline to sell cars to us on terms or at prices consistent with past agreements, despite sourcing vehicles from the used car\\nmarket and other efforts to mitigate, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles to operate our Express Drive or Lyft Rentals businesses without\\nsignificantly increasing our fleet costs or reducing our volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public health crises such as the COVID-19\\npandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or ability to rent vehicles in Lyft Rentals or\\nthe Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in\\n34\\nreduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleet. Reduced utilization has increased and could continue to increase costs of maintaining the fleet or storing or moving\\nunused vehicles.\\nThe costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. We currently sell vehicles through auctions,\\nthird-party resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices. It may be difficult to estimate\\nthe residual value of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through our Express Drive program. Further, market events, such as the COVID-\\n19 pandemic, have affected the demand for or pricing in the used vehicle market. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, other operators of large\\nfleets,  such  as  rental  companies,  are  reportedly  seeking  to  place  large  volumes  of  vehicles  into  the  resale  market,  which  have  driven  down  the  price  and\\ncorresponding residual value of used vehicles. A reduction in residual values for vehicles in our fleet could cause us to sustain a substantial loss on the ultimate sale\\nof such vehicles or require us to depreciate those vehicles at a more accelerated rate while we own them. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the fleet of\\nvehicles cost-efficiently  or if we are unable to accurately forecast the residual values of vehicles in the fleet, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform, and if we cannot manage our\\nrelationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform. If any\\nof our third-party payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would\\nneed to find an alternate payment processor, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable time frame. Further,\\nthe software and services provided by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised or\\nexperience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to\\ndrivers on our platform, any of which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to users and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified\\ndrivers and riders.\\nNearly all rider payments and driver payouts are made by credit card, debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain\\npayment network or service provider operating rules, to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to riders that\\nmay be subject to additional operating rules, regulations and risks. We may be also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we\\naccept from riders, including with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and\\nregulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment\\ncard transactions, which could make our offerings less convenient and attractive to riders. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nFor example, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable regulation, we could be subject to certain laws, rules and regulations\\nenforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and numerous state and local agencies who may define money transmitter differently.\\nFor example, certain states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we could be\\nsubject to additional laws, rules and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign\\nregulations and regulators governing our business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable\\nregulation and we are not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal or state\\nor local regulators,  including state Attorneys General, as well as those levied by foreign regulators.  In addition to fines, penalties  for failing to comply with\\napplicable  rules  and  regulations  could  include  criminal  and  civil  proceedings,  forfeiture  of  significant  assets  or  other  enforcement  actions.  We  could  also  be\\nrequired to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\\nFor various payment options, we are required to pay fees such as interchange and processing fees that are imposed by payment processors, payment\\nnetworks and financial institutions. These fees are subject to increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nAdditionally,  our  payment  processors  require  us  to  comply  with  payment  card  network  operating  rules,  which  are  set  and  interpreted  by  the  payment  card\\nnetworks. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing\\ncertain offerings to some users, be costly to implement or difficult to follow. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors for fines they are assessed by\\npayment card networks if we or the users on our platform violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe rely on other third-party service providers and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may\\nincrease and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur  success  depends  in  part  on  our  relationships  with  other  third-party  service  providers.  For  example,  we  rely  on  third-party  encryption  and\\nauthentication technologies licensed from third parties that are designed to securely transmit personal information provided by drivers and riders on our platform.\\nFurther, from time to time, we enter into strategic commercial partnerships in\\n35\\nconnection with the development of new technology, the growth of our qualified driver base, the provision of new or enhanced offerings for users on our platform\\nand our expansion into new markets. If any of our partners terminates its relationship with us, including as a result of COVID-19-related impacts to their business\\nand  operations  or  for  competitive  reasons,  or  refuses  to  renew  its  agreement  with  us  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  we  would  need  to  find  an  alternate\\nprovider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such providers in an acceptable time frame. We also rely on other software and services supplied\\nby third parties, such as communications and internal software, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such software and services do not meet\\nour expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could increase our costs and adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any negative publicity related to any of our third-party partners, including any publicity related to\\nquality standards or safety concerns, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\\nWe incorporate technology from third parties into our platform. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights\\nof others or that the suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the technology in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Some of our license agreements\\nmay be terminated  by our licensors for convenience.  If we are unable to obtain or maintain  rights to any of this technology  because of intellectual  property\\ninfringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into\\nnew agreements on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop our platform containing that technology could be severely limited and our business could\\nbe harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternate technology, which\\nmay require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards. This would limit and delay our ability to provide new or competitive\\nofferings and increase our costs. If alternate technology cannot be obtained or developed, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of our offerings,\\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we are not able to successfully develop new offerings on our platform and enhance our existing offerings, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nOur ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and increase utilization of our offerings will\\ndepend in part on our ability to successfully create and introduce new offerings and to improve upon and enhance our existing offerings. As a result, we may\\nintroduce significant changes to our existing offerings or develop and introduce new and unproven offerings. For example, in 2018, we launched our scooter\\nsharing offering on our platform in certain markets and in April 2020, we began piloting a delivery service platform in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If\\nthese new or enhanced offerings are unsuccessful, including as a result of any inability to obtain and maintain required permits or authorizations or other regulatory\\nconstraints or because they fail to generate sufficient return on our investments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected. Furthermore, new driver or rider demands regarding service or platform features, the availability of superior competitive offerings or a deterioration in the\\nquality of our offerings or our ability to bring new or enhanced offerings to market quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the attractiveness of our platform\\nand the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to and additional investments in our offerings or our business model. In addition, we\\nfrequently experiment with and test different offerings and marketing strategies. If these experiments and tests are unsuccessful, or if the offerings and strategies\\nwe introduce based on the results of such experiments and tests do not perform as expected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain\\nexisting qualified drivers and existing riders and maintain or increase utilization of our offerings may be adversely affected.\\nDeveloping and launching new offerings or enhancements to the existing offerings on our platform involves significant risks and uncertainties, including\\nrisks related to the reception of such offerings by existing and potential future drivers and riders, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated delays or\\nchallenges in implementing such offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of our ability to\\naccurately forecast rider demand and the number of drivers using our platform) and negative publicity in the event such new or enhanced offerings are perceived to\\nbe unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new initiatives have in the past resulted in, and in the future may result in, operational\\nchallenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new offerings and enhancements to our existing offerings may involve significant up-front\\ncapital investments and such investments may not generate return on investment. Further, from time to time we may reevaluate, discontinue and/or reduce these\\ninvestments and decide to discontinue one or more offerings. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain\\nqualified drivers and riders, our ability to increase utilization of our offerings and our visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, since we are focused on building our community and ecosystems for the long-term, our near-\\nterm results of operations may be impacted by our investments in the future.\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our expanding multimodal platform, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nOur expansion  into  bike  and scooter  sharing,  other  modes  of  transportation,  auto  repair  and  collision  services,  vehicle  rental  programs  and delivery\\nservices has increased the complexity of our business. These new offerings have required us to develop new expertise and marketing and operational strategies, and\\nhave subjected us to new laws, regulations and risks. For example, we face the\\n36\\nrisk that our network of shared bikes and scooters, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party public transit data into the Lyft App, and other future\\ntransportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering. Additionally, from time to time we may reevaluate our offerings on our multimodal\\nplatform and decide to discontinue an offering or certain features. Such actions may negatively impact revenue in the short term and may not provide the benefits\\nwe expect in the long term. If we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our expanding multimodal platform, including the effects our\\nnew and evolving offerings have on our existing business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur new delivery service platform may not be successful and may expose us to additional risks.\\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are piloting a new delivery service platform for a period of time to assess its feasibility. This offering, which\\nbegan in April 2020, currently allows businesses to send goods, including meals and medical supplies, from one location to another. Drivers are provided the\\nopportunity to opt-in to receive delivery requests and are currently paid based on the driver rate card for a standard Lyft ride. Delivery is not currently available in\\nall markets and therefore not all drivers have the opportunity to receive delivery requests at this time. We face a number of challenges that may affect the ultimate\\nsuccess of this offering, including:\\n•\\nthe market for this offering may not be sustained following the COVID-19 pandemic, or may not develop at all;\\n•\\nwe may be unable to attract and retain drivers for this offering, and drivers currently using our platform may not opt-in to drive for this offering, which\\nmay create shortages of driver supply;\\n•\\nwe may be unable to attract and retain businesses to participate in this offering;\\n•\\nwe may fail to develop an effective pricing model for this offering that incentivizes drivers and businesses to use this offering while maintaining margins\\nfor us;\\n•\\nour competitors may have more experience with respect to business or consumer deliveries, greater brand recognition in the delivery space, or greater\\nfinancial or other resources that enable them to derive greater revenue, attract and retain drivers and businesses for their similar offerings, and more\\nefficiently provide their offerings;\\n•\\nwe may incur additional costs and expenses associated with providing business or consumer delivery services, including insurance-related and other costs;\\n•\\nwe may be subject to litigation in a number of areas, including personal injury and automotive liability, and we may be unsuccessful in compelling to\\narbitration claims brought by drivers providing rideshare and delivery services on the Lyft Platform;\\n•\\nwe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that are costly to comply with and may affect the profitability of this offering, including laws and\\nregulations regarding pricing, and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations will adversely affect our deliveries offering;\\n•\\nthe recent passage of Proposition 22 in California may have an impact on delivery rate cards, which could impact our competitiveness and ability to\\noperate within California; and\\n•\\nwe may fail to effectively respond to market developments in a timely manner, or at all.\\nAdditionally, the development of this delivery service platform may divert resources, including management’s attention, from our other offerings and\\nadversely affect their development. If we are unable to develop and grow our delivery service platform, or unable to do so cost-effectively, whether as a result of\\nour own actions or market conditions more generally, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur  metrics  and  estimates,  including  the  key  metrics  included  in  this  report,  are  subject  to  inherent  challenges  in  measurement,  and  real  or  perceived\\ninaccuracies in those metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nWe regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics used to evaluate our growth, measure our performance and make strategic\\ndecisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been evaluated by a third-party. Our metrics may differ from estimates published\\nby third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or the assumptions on which we rely, and we may make\\nmaterial adjustments to our processes for calculating our metrics in order to enhance accuracy, because better information becomes available or other reasons,\\nwhich may result in changes to our metrics. The estimates and forecasts we disclose relating to the size and expected growth of our addressable market may prove\\nto be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth we have forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates,\\nif at all. If investors or analysts do not consider our metrics to be accurate representations\\n37\\nof our business, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, then the trading price of our Class A common stock and our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\\nPromoting awareness of our offerings is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new qualified drivers and new riders and can be\\ncostly. We believe that much of the growth in our rider base and the number of drivers on our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our\\nmarketing  efforts  currently  include  referrals,  affiliate  programs,  free  or  discount  trials,  partnerships,  display  advertising,  television,  billboards,  radio,  video,\\ncontent, direct mail, social media, email, hiring and classified advertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization and keyword\\nsearch campaigns. Our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult. Even if\\nwe successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset the additional marketing expenses we incur.\\nIf our marketing efforts are not successful in promoting awareness of our offerings or attracting new qualified drivers and new riders, or if we are not able\\nto cost-effectively manage our marketing expenses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. If our marketing efforts are successful in increasing\\nawareness of our offerings, this could also lead to increased public scrutiny of our business and increase the likelihood of third parties bringing legal proceedings\\nagainst us. Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we\\nhave slowed our marketing efforts across certain platforms, which may limit the effectiveness of our other marketing efforts and limit awareness of our offerings.\\nAny failure to offer high-quality user support may harm our relationships with users and could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders is dependent in part on the ease and reliability of our offerings, including our ability to provide\\nhigh-quality support. Users on our platform depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our offerings, such as being overcharged for a ride,\\nleaving something in a driver’s vehicle or reporting a safety incident. Our ability to provide effective and timely support is largely dependent on our ability to\\nattract and retain service providers who are qualified to support users and sufficiently knowledgeable regarding our offerings. As we continue to grow our business\\nand improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing quality support services at scale. If we grow our international rider base and the number of\\ninternational drivers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support in languages other\\nthan English. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to provide effective and timely support, including as a result of a decrease in the\\navailability of service providers and increase in response time. Any failure to provide efficient user support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-\\nquality support, could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business.\\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, claims\\nof unauthorized payments by a rider, attempted payments by riders with insufficient funds and fraud committed by riders in concert with drivers. Bad actors use\\nincreasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person’s identity, account\\ninformation or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information and mobile phone numbers and\\naccounts. Under current card payment practices, we may be liable for rides facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated\\nfinancial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures that we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious\\nactivity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our inability to adequately\\ndetect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or regulatory action and lead to expenses that could adversely affect\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe have also incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from fraud and other misuse of our platform by drivers and riders, including in connection with\\nprograms we put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides\\nfulfilled and miles traveled in connection with our Concierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased\\ncontrols, platform solutions or other means, our partner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to effectively match riders on our Shared and Shared Saver Rides offering and manage the related pricing methodologies, our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nShared and Shared Saver Rides enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to benefit from a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer\\ntravel times. With a Shared or Shared Saver Ride, when the first rider requests a ride, our algorithms use the first rider’s destination and attempt to match them\\nwith other riders traveling along a similar route. If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched\\nrider on the active route. For Shared and\\n38\\nShared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to riders and the\\nlevel of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able to\\nmatch additional riders along the given route, and such fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled\\nfrom the payment made to the driver as we do not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted\\nand charged to our Shared or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared\\nor Shared Saver Rides riders, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended Shared and Shared Saver Rides on our platform. While we believe these suspensions are in the\\nbest interests of drivers and riders on our platform, these suspensions have adversely affected our business and results of operations. We currently do not have a\\ntimetable for ending this suspension in whole or in part, and to the extent we continue to suspend these offerings during the COVID-19 pandemic, or demand for\\nthese offerings is adversely affected following the end of these suspensions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to effectively manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWith the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn fees\\nfrom drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an up-front quoted fare and the amount earned by a driver based on the actual time\\nand distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver incentives and any pass-through amounts\\npaid to drivers and regulatory agencies. As we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take\\non risks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider is\\nless than the amount we committed to pay a driver. In addition, riders’ price sensitivity varies by geographic location, among other factors, and if we are unable to\\neffectively account for such variability in our up-front prices, our ability to compete effectively in these locations could be adversely affected. If we are unable to\\neffectively manage our up-front pricing methodology in conjunction with our existing and future pricing and incentive programs, our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, applications, platform or offerings could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects\\nor  malfunctions,  distributed  denial-of-service  and  other  cyberattacks,  human  error,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  floods,  fires,  natural  disasters,  power  losses,\\ndisruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware or other events. Our\\nsystems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, theft and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems are not fully\\nredundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of\\nour losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability\\nor  reduce  or affect  the  speed  or functionality  of  our  offerings.  These  events  have  resulted  in,  and  similar  future  events  could  result  in,  losses  of  revenue.  A\\nprolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our offerings could adversely affect our business and\\nreputation and could result in the loss of users. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in harm or losses to the users using our\\nplatform, we may make voluntary payments to compensate for such harm or the affected users could seek monetary recourse or contractual remedies from us for\\ntheir losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.\\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.\\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy and support for others, has been critical to our success. We face a number of\\nchallenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\\n•\\nfailure to identify, attract, reward and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values and mission;\\n•\\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\\n•\\nshelter-in-place orders in certain jurisdictions where we operate that have required many of our employees to work remotely;\\n•\\nthe inability to achieve adherence to our internal policies and core values, including our diversity, equity and inclusion practices and initiatives;\\n39\\n•\\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values;\\n•\\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry;\\n•\\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\\n•\\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees or our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\\n•\\nthe provision of employee benefits in the COVID-19 environment; and\\n•\\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\\nFrom time to time, we have undertaken workforce reductions in order to better align our operations with our strategic priorities, managing our cost\\nstructure or in connection with acquisitions. For example, in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we took certain cost-cutting\\nmeasures,  including  lay-offs,  furloughs  and  salary  reductions,  which  may  adversely  affect  employee  morale,  our  culture  and  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain\\nemployees. These actions may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain personnel and maintain our culture. If we are not able to maintain our culture, our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain, motivate or integrate our personnel, our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur  success  depends  in  part  on  the  continued  service  of  our  founders,  senior  management  team,  key  technical  employees  and  other  highly  skilled\\npersonnel and on our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. We may not be\\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs and actions we take in response to the impact of the COVID-19\\npandemic on our business may harm our reputation or impact our ability to recruit qualified personnel in the future. For example, in April 2020, in response to the\\neffects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  business,  we  took  certain  cost-cutting  measures,  including  lay-offs,  furloughs  and  salary  reductions,  which  may\\nadversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees. Also, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our management\\nteam, work for us on an at-will basis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and\\nhiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive\\nterms or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.\\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled personnel, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for\\nhighly skilled personnel. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and\\nbenefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the\\nperceived value of our equity awards declines or we are unable to provide competitive compensation packages, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and\\nretain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition. Certain of our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity\\nin private transactions and many of our employees have received and may continue to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\\nwhich may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees\\nand expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are\\nunable to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts and employee morale, productivity and\\nretention could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users and unfavorable changes in or our failure to\\ncomply with existing or future laws governing the Internet and mobile devices.\\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device and the Internet. We may operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet\\nconnectivity, particularly as we expand internationally. Internet access and access to a mobile device are frequently provided by companies with significant market\\npower that could take actions that degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of users’ ability to access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and\\nusers of our platform rely on in any particular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device\\naccessibility, even for a short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nMoreover,  we  are  subject  to  a  number  of  laws  and  regulations  specifically  governing  the  Internet  and  mobile  devices  that  are  constantly  evolving.\\nExisting and future laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth and availability of the Internet and online offerings, require us to change our\\nbusiness practices or raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover taxation, privacy and\\ndata protection, pricing, copyrights, distribution, mobile and other communications, advertising practices, consumer protections, the provision of online payment\\nservices, unencumbered Internet access to our offerings and the characteristics and quality of online offerings, among other things. Any failure,\\n40\\nor perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand a loss in business and proceedings or\\nactions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our apps available to the drivers and riders on our platform, and if we do not\\neffectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such application marketplaces and maintain high rider reviews, our usage or brand recognition\\ncould decline and our business, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application marketplaces to make our apps available to the\\ndrivers and riders on our platform. Any changes in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our apps or give preferential\\ntreatment to our competitors’ apps could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile devices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces\\nlimit or prohibit us from making our apps available to drivers and riders, make changes that degrade the functionality of our apps, increase the cost of using our\\napps, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in\\nsuch mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our apps, overall growth in our rider or driver base could slow.\\nOur apps have experienced fluctuations in number of downloads in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to support our platform or\\neffectively roll out updates to our apps. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need to ensure that our offerings are designed to work effectively\\nwith a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants\\nin the mobile industry that enhance drivers’ and riders’ experience. If drivers or riders on our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our apps on their\\nmobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected.\\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not control.\\nWe have integrations with a variety of productivity, collaboration, travel, data management and security vendors. As our offerings expand and evolve,\\nincluding to the extent we continue to develop autonomous technology, we may have an increasing number of integrations with other third-party applications,\\nproducts and services. Third-party applications, products and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to\\nensure its compatibility with third-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or technology partners may take actions\\nwhich disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which\\nwe operate and distribute our platform. As our respective products evolve, we expect the types and levels of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors\\nor technology partners modify their products, standards or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise\\nunsatisfactory  to  us  or  gives  preferential  treatment  to  competitive  products  or  services,  our  products,  platform,  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nDefects, errors or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems or other technology systems and those of third-party technology providers could harm\\nour reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after\\nthe code has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment,” which refers to the frequent release of our\\nsoftware code, sometimes multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying our\\nplatform. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerability. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in\\nour code or from third-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue and access or other performance issues. Such\\nvulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a data breach as defined\\nunder various laws and regulations. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or\\ndefects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations as well as negatively impact our reputation or brand.\\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses\\ncould restrict our ability to provide our offerings.\\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and distribution of open source software\\nmay entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors\\n41\\ngenerally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition,\\nthe public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our platform.\\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type\\nof open source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain\\nmanner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our\\ncompetitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to\\navoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our\\nsoftware.\\nAlthough we have processes for using open source software to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open\\nsource  licenses  have  not  been  interpreted  by  U.S.  or  foreign  courts,  and  there  is  a  risk  that  these  licenses  could  be  construed  in  a  way  that  could  impose\\nunanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of\\nopen source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming\\nownership of what we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in\\nour platform will be effective. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we\\ncould  face  infringement  or  other  liability,  or  be  required  to  seek  costly  licenses  from  third  parties  to  continue  providing  our  offerings  on  terms  that  are  not\\neconomically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely\\nbasis or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nOur presence outside the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be\\nsuccessful.\\nWe have started expanding our presence internationally. In 2017, we launched our offerings in Canada and we may continue to expand our international\\nofferings. In addition, we have several international offices that support our business. Operating outside of the United States may require significant management\\nattention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics,\\ncompliance, legal, engineering and operations teams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a\\nvariety of reasons, including:\\n•\\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;\\n•\\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively and may enjoy greater local affinity\\nor awareness;\\n•\\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our offerings less successful;\\n•\\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses;\\n•\\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to data privacy, tax, trade compliance, and local regulatory restrictions;\\n•\\ncomplying with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions;\\n•\\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses or other authorizations;\\n•\\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\\n•\\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\\n•\\npolitical, economic, or social instability, which has caused disruptions in certain of our office locations, including in Belarus;\\n•\\noperating in jurisdictions where we do not have, or that do not protect, intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States; and\\n•\\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake may\\nnot be successful, which may result in shutting down international operations or closing international offices. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand\\nour operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\n42\\nIn addition,  international  expansion  has  increased  our  risks  in  complying  with  the  constantly-evolving  laws  and  standards,  including  with  respect  to\\ncustoms, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls and trade and economic sanctions. We cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions\\nin violation of applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. In particular, any violation of the applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export\\ncontrols and similar laws could result in adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or\\ncivil sanctions or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, or substantial diversion of management’s attention, all of which could have an adverse\\neffect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs,\\nridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product\\nliability, defects, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer protection, taxation, privacy,\\ndata  security,  competition,  unionizing  and  collective  action,  arbitration  agreements  and  class  action  waiver  provisions,  terms  of  service,  mobile  application\\naccessibility,  autonomous  vehicles,  bike  and  scooter  sharing,  insurance,  vehicle  rentals,  money  transmittal,  non-emergency  medical  transportation,  healthcare\\nfraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import and export restrictions, trade and\\neconomic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable\\nfoods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in\\npractice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such\\nas federal, state and local administrative agencies.\\nThe ridesharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a peer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace\\nin 2012, the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that were in existence at that time, and some that\\nhave since been adopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the\\ngrowth of our ridesharing marketplace. We have been proactively working with federal, state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our\\nridesharing marketplace and other offerings are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part due to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have\\nadopted laws related to TNCs to address the unique issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations\\ncontinue  to  be  adopted,  implemented  and  interpreted  in  response  to  our  industry  and  related  technologies.  As  we  expand  our  business  into  new  markets  or\\nintroduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may claim that we or users on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that\\nwe are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or that users on our platform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or\\nwith respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, including airports, require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain\\nreporting and other compliance requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter sharing, auto repair and collision services, Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals and\\nautonomous vehicle offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our applications for permits, revoke existing or deny renewals of permits to\\noperate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose fines and penalties, including as a result of errors in, or failures to\\ncomply with, reporting or other requirements related to our product offerings. Any of the foregoing actions by these jurisdictions and governmental entities could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nRecent financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and\\ncompanies engaged in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate\\nnew regulations that are adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in the market or\\notherwise, they may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. See the risk factor\\nentitled “Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our\\nbusiness.” Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another, and may have a negative outcome that\\ncould  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.  Additionally,  we  have  invested  and from  time  to  time  we  will\\ncontinue to invest resources in an attempt to influence or challenge legislation and other regulatory matters pertinent to our operations, particularly those related to\\nthe  ridesharing  industry,  which  may  negatively  impact  the  legal  and  administrative  proceedings  challenging  the  classification  of  drivers  on  our  platform  as\\nindependent contractors if we are unsuccessful or lead to additional costs and expenses even if we are successful. These activities may not be successful, and any\\nnegative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur industry is relatively nascent and is rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and\\nmunicipal regulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have\\n43\\nimposed limitations on or attempted to ban ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing. For example, in December 2018, the New York City Taxi & Limousine\\nCommission adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings calculations and utilization rates applicable to our ridesharing platform, as well as certain other\\nridesharing platforms. In January 2019, we filed an Article 78 Petition through two of our subsidiaries challenging these rules before the Supreme Court of the\\nState of New York, which was denied in May 2019. In December 2019, we appealed this decision and in December 2020, our appeal was denied. The City of\\nSeattle also adopted the Transportation  Network Company Driver Minimum Compensation Ordinance  effective  January 1, 2021, which sets minimum driver\\nearnings calculations for our rideshare platform as well as other rideshare platforms. Other jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may want to operate\\ncould follow suit. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operations internationally, particularly in areas where we\\nface competition from local incumbents. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on or material limitations to our offerings\\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses that perceive our business model negatively to raise their\\nconcerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant\\nresources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to change such legal and\\nregulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.\\nAny of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChallenges  to  contractor  classification  of  drivers  that  use  our  platform  may  have  adverse  business,  financial,  tax,  legal  and  other  consequences  to  our\\nbusiness.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory\\nproceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing\\nwhether a driver is an independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the\\nstatus and misclassification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities which can create uncertainty and\\nunpredictability for us. For example, Assembly Bill 5 (as codified in part at Cal. Labor Code sec. 2750.3) codified and extended an employment classification test\\nin Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court, which established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of\\nthis bill led to additional challenges to the independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California\\nAttorney General and the City Attorneys of Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco filed a lawsuit against us and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on\\nthe companies’ respective platforms as independent contractors in violation of Assembly Bill 5 and California’s Unfair Competition Law, and on August 5, 2020,\\nthe California Labor Commissioner filed lawsuits against us and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective platforms as independent\\ncontractors,  seeking  injunctive  relief  and  material  damages  and  penalties.  On  June  25,  2020,  the  California  Attorney  General  and  the  City  Attorneys  of  Los\\nAngeles, San Diego, and San Francisco filed a motion for preliminary injunction against us and Uber. On August 10, 2020, the court granted the motion for a\\npreliminary injunction, forcing us and Uber to reclassify drivers in California as employees until the end of the lawsuit. On August 12, 2020, we filed a notice of\\nappeal of the court\\'s order and on August 20, 2020, the California Court of Appeal stayed the preliminary injunction pending resolution of the appeal. The Court of\\nAppeal affirmed the preliminary injunction on October 22, 2020. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a\\nframework for drivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and Proposition 22 went into effect on\\nDecember 16, 2020. We filed a petition for rehearing of our appeal with the California Court of Appeal on November 6, 2020, which was denied on November 20,\\n2020. On December 1, 2020, we filed a petition for review with the California Supreme Court, which was denied on February 10, 2021. The case will now proceed\\nin San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a lawsuit was filed in the California Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition\\n22 violates the California Constitution. The Supreme Court denied review on February 3, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior\\nCourt on February 12, 2021. Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a lawsuit against us and Uber for allegedly misclassifying\\ndrivers on the companies\\' respective platforms as independent contractors under Massachusetts wage and hour laws, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. We\\ncontinue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in such legal and administrative proceedings and intend to continue to defend ourself\\nvigorously in these matters, but our arguments may ultimately be unsuccessful. A determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to\\nsuch  legal  proceeding  or  not,  that  classifies  a  driver  of  a  ridesharing  platform  as  an  employee,  could  harm  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of\\noperations, including as a result of:\\n•\\nmonetary exposure arising from or relating to failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and hour laws and requirements (such as those\\npertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide required breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and\\npunitive damages, penalties, including related to the California Private Attorneys General Act, and government fines;\\n•\\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\\n•\\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation and unemployment;\\n44\\n•\\nclaims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation under civil rights laws;\\n•\\nclaims under new or existing laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining and other concerted activity;\\n•\\nother claims, charges or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees, including risks relating to allegations of\\njoint employer liability or agency liability; and\\n•\\nharm to our reputation and brand.\\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an\\nemployee  may  require  us  to  significantly  alter  our  existing  business  model  and/or  operations  (including  suspending  or  ceasing  operations  in  impacted\\njurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\\nWe have been involved in numerous legal proceedings related to driver classification. We are currently involved in several putative class actions, several\\nrepresentative actions brought, for example, pursuant to California’s Private Attorney General Act, several multi-plaintiff actions and thousands of individual\\nclaims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform\\nas independent contractors. We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in California, Connecticut, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois and\\nNew Jersey. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\\nThe results of Proposition 22 in California have caused us to alter our operations and incur additional costs and we may face additional challenges as we\\nimplement these changes.\\nThe recent passage of Proposition 22 in California led us to continue providing flexible earning opportunities to drivers in California. We expect that this\\ntransition will require additional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including the logistics of providing the\\nadditional earning opportunities, as well as potential changes to our pricing. The change in model may also affect our ability to attract and retain drivers and riders.\\nTo the extent similar classification models are adopted in other jurisdictions, we may face similar costs and challenges. Notwithstanding the passage of Proposition\\n22, we continue to face litigation in California, including to overturn Proposition 22, and in other jurisdictions which may in the future require us to classify drivers\\nas employees if we are unsuccessful in our ongoing litigation.\\nClaims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\\nCompanies  in  the  Internet  and  technology  industries  are  frequently  subject  to  litigation  based  on  allegations  of  infringement  or  other  violations  of\\nintellectual property rights. In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own,\\nhave purchased or otherwise obtained. As we gain an increasingly high public profile and the number of competitors in our market increases, the possibility of\\nintellectual property rights claims against us grows. From time to time third parties may assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual\\nproperty rights against us. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties\\nhave  sent  us  correspondence  regarding  various  allegations  of  intellectual  property  infringement  and,  in  some  instances,  have  initiated  licensing  discussions.\\nAlthough we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against these allegations or reaching a\\nbusiness resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than\\nus. In addition, future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against\\nwhom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding\\ncompanies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to assert their intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement by a third-party, even those\\nwithout merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease\\nuse of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk\\ncompromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees in connection with\\na claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us from using or distributing our intellectual\\nproperty, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights,\\nwhich may not be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-\\nexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual\\nproperty on reasonable terms, or at all, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require\\nsignificant time (during which we would be unable to continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of\\nthese events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n45\\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other\\nforms of information, knowhow and technology), or intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress,\\ntrade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may\\nnot be sufficient  or effective,  and may vary by jurisdiction.  Even if we do detect  violations, we may need to engage in litigation  to enforce our rights. Any\\nenforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert management attention. While we take precautions\\ndesigned to protect our intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and other unauthorized third parties to copy our technology and use our\\nproprietary  information  to  create  or  enhance  competing  solutions  and  services,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  position  in  our  rapidly  evolving  and  highly\\ncompetitive industry. Some license provisions that protect against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our technology may be unenforceable\\nunder the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. The laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property as\\ndo the laws of the United States and effective intellectual property protections may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Our domestic and\\ninternational intellectual property protection and enforcement strategy is influenced by many considerations including costs, where we have business operations,\\nwhere we might have business operations in the future, legal protections available in a specific jurisdiction, and/or other strategic considerations. As such, we do\\nnot have identical or analogous intellectual  property protection in all jurisdictions, which could risk freedom to operate in certain jurisdictions if we were to\\nexpand.  As  we  expand  our  international  activities,  our  exposure  to  unauthorized  use,  copying,  transfer  and  disclosure  of  proprietary  information  will  likely\\nincrease. We may need to expend additional resources to protect, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights domestically or internationally, which could\\nimpair our business or adversely affect our domestic or international  operations. We enter into confidentiality  and invention assignment agreements with our\\nemployees  and  consultants  and  enter  into  confidentiality  agreements  with  our  third-party  providers  and  strategic  partners.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  these\\nagreements will be effective in controlling access to, and use and distribution of, our platform and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not\\nprevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our offerings. We also enter into strategic\\npartnerships, joint development and other similar agreements with third parties where intellectual property arising from such partnerships may be jointly-owned or\\nmay  be  transferred  or  licensed  to  the  counterparty.  Such  arrangements  may  limit  our  ability  to  protect,  maintain,  enforce  or  commercialize  such  intellectual\\nproperty  rights,  including  requiring  agreement  with  or  payment  to  our  joint  development  partners  before  protecting,  maintaining,  licensing  or  initiating\\nenforcement of such intellectual property rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such intellectual property\\nrights in a manner that may affect the value of the jointly-owned intellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.\\nWe may be required to spend significant resources in order to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and some violations may be difficult or\\nimpossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could\\nresult  in  the  impairment  or  loss  of  portions  of  our  intellectual  property.  Our  efforts  to  enforce  our  intellectual  property  rights  may  be  met  with  defenses,\\ncounterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and\\nproprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could impair\\nthe functionality of our platform, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our\\nplatform or harm our reputation or brand. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings\\nor platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\\nOur industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, particularly regarding autonomous vehicle development, including by foreign\\nactors. We, along with others in our industry, have been the target of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future.\\nAlthough we take measures to protect our property, if we are unable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments\\nmay be undermined and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to\\ncomply  with  such  laws  and  regulations  or  any  other  obligations  relating  to  privacy,  data  protection  or  the  protection  or  transfer  of  personal  data,  could\\nadversely affect our business.\\nWe receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other data relating to the users on our platform. Numerous local,\\nmunicipal, state, federal and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection\\nof certain types of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling\\nthe Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S.\\nFederal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer\\nPrivacy Act, or CCPA, and the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which becomes operative on January 1, 2023. These laws, rules and regulations evolve\\nfrequently and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to\\n46\\nexisting legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the CPRA will require new disclosures to\\nCalifornia consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information. The CPRA provides for fines\\nof up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcement remain unclear. The\\neffects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies and incur additional\\ncompliance-related  costs  and  expenses.  The  CPRA  and  other  changes  in  laws  or  regulations  relating  to  privacy,  data  protection  and  information  security,\\nparticularly any new or modified laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data retention,\\ntransfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our offerings, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing\\ncertain offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in the future.\\nFurther, as we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional privacy-related laws and regulations. For\\nexample, the collection and storage of data in connection with the use of our Concierge platform by healthcare partners subjects us to compliance requirements\\nunder  HIPAA.  HIPAA  and  its  implementing  regulations  contain  requirements  regarding  the  use,  collection,  security,  storage  and  disclosure  of  individuals’\\nprotected health information, or PHI. In 2009, HIPAA was amended by the HITECH Act to impose certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements directly\\nupon  business  associates  of  covered  entities.  Contracted  healthcare  entities  including  healthcare  providers,  health  plans,  and  transportation  brokers  using  our\\nConcierge offering are either covered entities or business associates under HIPAA. We must also comply with HIPAA as we use and disclose the PHI of riders in\\nour capacity as a business associate of other contracted healthcare entities. Compliance obligations under HIPAA include privacy, security and breach notification\\nobligations, and could subject us to increased liability for any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI determined to be a “breach.” If we knowingly breach the\\nHITECH Act’s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to civil penalties that range from\\n$100 - $50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum per violation calendar year cap of $1.5 million for identical incidences and the possibility of civil litigation.\\nAdditionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information\\nsecurity standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the\\nCCPA and CPRA imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other\\nlaws  and  regulations,  we  may  face  challenges  in  addressing  their  requirements  and  making  necessary  changes  to  our  policies  and  practices,  and  may  incur\\nsignificant costs and expenses in an effort to do so. In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our\\nhealthcare customers under our agreements with them. As we consider expansion of business offerings and markets and as laws and regulations change, we expect\\nto incur additional costs related to privacy, data protection and information security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or\\ncontractual obligations related to such offerings and face additional risks that such expansion could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all\\nrequirements of such laws, regulations or obligations.\\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is\\npossible that our practices, offerings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or\\nobligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to\\nprivacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personally identifiable\\ninformation or other driver or rider data, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation,\\ndiscourage new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation,\\nany of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy\\nconcerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary\\ncourse of business, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial\\ndisputes, competition, consumer complaints, intellectual property disputes, compliance with regulatory requirements, securities laws and other matters, and we\\nmay become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations and legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy\\nnew offerings such as autonomous vehicles, Driver Centers and Mobile Services, our network of shared bikes and scooters and deliveries, including proceedings\\nrelated to product liability or our acquisitions, securities issuances or business practices. We are also regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,\\ngovernment investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings seeking to hold us liable for the actions of independent contractor drivers on our platform.\\nSee the section titled “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\\n47\\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations or other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted\\nwith  certainty.  Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  time-consuming,  result  in  costly  litigation,  be  harmful  to  our  reputation,  require\\nsignificant management attention and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that\\nrequires significant subjective judgment and speculation. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages,\\nsettlement costs, fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These proceedings could also result in\\nharm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions or other orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences\\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal\\nobligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and current and former directors and officers.\\nA determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that involves our industry, could harm\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a determination that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, whether\\nwe are party to such determination or not, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.\\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders on our platform. These provisions are intended\\nto streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court.\\nHowever, arbitration may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may\\nsubject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to\\nour reputation and brand, we may limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase\\nour litigation costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees.\\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and\\nfederal law, there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of\\nprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we\\ncould experience an increase in our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs we expand our platform offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such\\nlaws and regulations or manage the increased costs associated with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nAs we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict\\nfrom one jurisdiction to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do\\nnot contemplate or address the unique issues faced by our industry.\\nFor example, the use of our Concierge offering by healthcare contracted entities and transportation brokers with which we partner may subject us to\\ncertain healthcare-related laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on us and our platform in providing rides to\\nhealthcare partners. Additional requirements may arise related to processing of payments, the collection and storage of data and systems infrastructure design, all\\nof which could increase the costs associated with our offerings to healthcare transportation partners. With respect to our healthcare rides provided to Medicaid or\\nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries, we are subject to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws that impose penalties for violations. Significant violations of such laws\\ncould lead to our loss of provider enrollment status, which could potentially result in exclusion from the federal programs as a provider. Further, we may in certain\\ncircumstances  be  or  become  considered  a  government  contractor  with  respect  to  certain  of  our  services,  which  would  expose  us  to  certain  risks  such  as  the\\ngovernment’s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector’s budgetary cycles and funding authorization, and the government’s administrative and\\ninvestigatory processes. Furthermore, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020 we began piloting a delivery service and rides matched through the\\nLyft Platform have been deemed an essential service by COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders in numerous jurisdictions, which may subject us to additional laws and\\nregulations, including limits on pricing.\\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to our platform offerings, it is possible that our practices,\\nofferings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the\\nfailure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to our platform offerings, could\\nharm  our  reputation  and  brand,  discourage  new  and  existing  drivers  and  riders  from  using  our  platform,  lead  to  refunds  of  rider  fares  or  result  in  fines  or\\nproceedings  by  governmental  agencies  or  private  claims  and  litigation,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of\\noperations.\\n48\\nWe face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection\\nlaws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of automated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted and may in the future\\nresult in civil claims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving\\nand developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail  to maintain an effective  system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,  our ability  to produce  timely  and accurate\\nfinancial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and\\nthe listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and\\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to\\nensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\\nperiods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our\\nprincipal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that\\nwe will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\\nover financial reporting.\\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including\\nincreased complexity resulting from any international expansion or from the expanded work-from-home practices of our employees in response to COVID-19\\nshelter-in-place orders. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure\\nto develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results of operations or cause us\\nto fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain\\neffective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered\\npublic accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic\\nreports commencing with this annual report on Form 10-K. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also\\ncause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market price of our Class A common\\nstock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\\nAdditionally, commencing with this annual report on Form 10-K, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the\\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not\\nsatisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure\\ncontrols and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause a\\ndecline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\\nWe have expended and intend to expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding liabilities that arise upon the settlement of RSUs, which may\\nhave an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have also implemented “sell-to-cover” for certain employees in which shares of\\nour Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf of RSU holders upon vesting and settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such\\nsales will result in dilution to our stockholders.\\nWe have expended and intend to expend substantial funds to satisfy tax withholding and remittance obligations in connection with the settlement of\\nRSUs. Since the initial settlement date for the RSUs that vested upon the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 related to our initial public\\noffering,  or  our  IPO  Registration  Statement,  we  have  withheld  shares  and  remitted  tax  withholding  amounts  on  behalf  of  holders  of  RSUs  at  the  applicable\\nstatutory rates. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we have expended a total of approximately $20.2 million to satisfy tax withholding and remittance\\nobligations in connection with the settlement of such RSUs.\\nTo satisfy future tax withholding and remittance obligations, we may withhold shares and remit tax withholding amounts on behalf of the holders of\\nRSUs  at  the  applicable  statutory  rates.  The  tax  withholding  due  in  connection  with  such  RSU  net  settlement  will  be  based  on  the  then-current  value  of  the\\nunderlying shares of our Class A common stock, and we would expect to withhold and remit the tax withholding liabilities at the applicable statutory rates on\\nbehalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities in cash. We have also implemented “sell-to-cover” to satisfy tax withholding obligations, in which shares\\nwith a market value equivalent to the tax withholding obligation will be sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover the tax\\nwithholding\\n49\\nliability and the cash proceeds from such sales will be remitted by us to the taxing authorities. Such sales will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us\\nto satisfy the tax withholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution to our stockholders.\\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar\\ntaxes  and  may  successfully  impose  additional  obligations  on  us,  and  any  such  assessments  or  obligations  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to businesses like\\nours and to drivers is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption\\nand growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts\\nrecorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing\\nstatutes might apply to our business or to drivers’ businesses.\\nIn  addition,  local  governments  are  increasingly  looking  for  ways  to  increase  revenue,  which  has  resulted  in  discussions  about  tax  reform  and  other\\nlegislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. For example, it is becoming more common for local governments to impose per trip fees\\nspecifically on TNC rides. As one example, voters in San Francisco approved “Proposition D” in November of 2019, which imposes a percentage-based tax on\\nTNC rides originating in the city. Such taxes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe  are  subject  to  non-income  taxes,  such  as  payroll,  sales,  use,  value-added  and  goods  and  services  taxes  in  the  United  States  and various  foreign\\njurisdictions, and we may face indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax\\nauthorities have raised and may continue to raise questions about or challenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting or collection of taxes and may require us\\nto collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and fees. A\\nsuccessful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a\\njurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could\\ndiscourage drivers and riders from utilizing our offerings or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have\\nreserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be\\nharmed.\\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping or indirect tax collection\\nobligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to\\ncalculate, collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related legislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court\\ndecision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain states have enacted laws that would require tax reporting, collection or tax remittance on items sold online.\\nRequiring tax reporting or collection could decrease driver or rider activity, which would harm our business. This new legislation could require us or drivers to\\nincur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our\\nofferings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and\\nany such difference may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the\\nultimate tax outcome is determined.\\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our\\nmanagement team have limited experience managing a public company.\\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject\\nto the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\\nProtection Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among\\nother things, we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to\\nmaintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and\\nwill continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to\\nstockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we\\ncannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more\\nvisible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\\nCertain members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and\\ncomplying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to\\nbeing a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and\\n50\\nreporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will\\nrequire significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\\nWe have established environmental programs such as our commitment to 100% electric vehicles (EVs) on our platform by the end of 2030, and requiring\\nour suppliers to ensure the efficient use of raw materials, water, and energy resources via our Supplier Code of Conduct, and we recognize that there are inherent\\nclimate- related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, our San Francisco, California headquarters are projected to be vulnerable to future water\\nscarcity and sea level rise due to climate change, as well as climate-related events including wildfires and associated power shut-offs. Climate-related events,\\nincluding the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our\\nbusiness, our third-party suppliers, and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or\\nresume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate change regulation such as California’s Senate Bill 1014, which will impose greenhouse gas\\nand EV requirements on our industry, and failure to meet the future requirements could have adverse impacts on our costs and ability to operate in California, as\\nwell as public goodwill towards our company. Finally, we advocate for EV programs that can be efficiently accessed by drivers on our platform and rental car\\noperators, and any failure of such programs to address EV capital costs, EV charging costs, and EV charging infrastructure in the context of transportation network\\ncompanies’ unique needs could challenge our ability to progress toward our 100% EV commitment.\\nRisks Related to Financing and Transactional Factors\\nWe may require additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\\nHistorically,  we  funded  our  capital-intensive  operations  and  capital  expenditures  primarily  through  equity  issuances  and  cash  generated  from  our\\noperations. To support our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our offerings. In May 2020, we issued\\n$747.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes and from time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, including by the issuance\\nof securities. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, such as our 2025 Notes, those securities may have rights,\\npreferences or privileges senior to those of our Class A common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Further, we have secured debt\\nfinancing which has resulted in fixed obligations and certain restrictive covenants, and any debt financing secured by us in the future would result in increased\\nfixed obligations and could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, as well as\\nliens on some or all of our assets, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\\nWe evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts,\\nbusiness plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Additionally, COVID-19 may impact our access\\nto capital and make additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available\\nto us on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue\\nto support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations\\ncould be adversely affected.\\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do not\\nachieve our objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, new\\ntechnologies,  services  and  other  assets  and  strategic  investments  that  complement  our  business,  such  as  our  acquisitions  of  Motivate  in  November  2018  and\\nFlexdrive in February 2020, as well as divestitures, partnerships and other transactions. We have previously acquired and continue to evaluate targets that operate\\nin relatively nascent markets, and as a result, there is no assurance that such acquired businesses will be successfully integrated into our business or generate\\nsubstantial revenue.\\nAcquisitions  involve  numerous  risks,  any  of  which  could  harm  our  business  and  negatively  affect  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations,\\nincluding:\\n•\\nintense  competition  for  suitable  acquisition  targets,  which  could  increase  acquisition  costs  and  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  consummate  deals  on\\nfavorable or acceptable terms;\\n•\\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\\n•\\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\\n•\\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company;\\n51\\n•\\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\\n•\\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\\n•\\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\\n•\\nfailure  to  identify  the  problems,  liabilities  or  other  shortcomings  or  challenges  of  an  acquired  company  or  technology,  including  issues  related  to\\nintellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\\n•\\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business;\\n•\\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\\n•\\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new offerings cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\\n•\\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.\\nIn addition, we may divest businesses or assets, enter into joint ventures or strategic partnerships or other strategic transactions. For example, we recently\\nannounced that we were exploring strategic options for our Level 5 self-driving system development program. These types of transactions present certain risks; for\\nexample, we may not achieve the desired strategic, operational and financial benefits of a divestiture, partnership, joint venture or other strategic transaction.\\nFurther, during the pendency of a divestiture or during the integration process of any strategic transaction, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the\\nbusiness, loss of employees, customers, or suppliers.\\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions of businesses, new technologies,\\nservices and other assets, strategic investments or other transactions, or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, or if we are unable to\\nsuccessfully complete other transactions or such transactions do not meet the our strategic objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition\\ncould be adversely affected.\\nServicing our current and future debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our\\nindebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our\\nflexibility in operating our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\\nIn  May  2020,  we  issued  our  2025  Notes  in  a  private  placement  to  qualified  institutional  buyers.  In  addition,  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of\\nFlexdrive, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, with a\\nthird-party lender, a Master Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender and a Vehicle Procurement Agreement,\\nas  amended,  with  a  third-party;  and,  following  the  acquisition,  we  continued  to  guarantee  the  payments  of  Flexdrive  for  any  amounts  borrowed  under  these\\nagreements. See Note 9 \"Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements, for further information on these agreements and our outstanding debt obligations. As of\\nDecember 31, 2020, we had $680.0 million of indebtedness for borrowed money outstanding.\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which\\nis  subject  to  economic,  financial,  competitive  and  other  factors  beyond  our  control.  Our  business  may  not  generate  cash  flow  from  operations  in  the  future\\nsufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more\\nalternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our\\nability to refinance any existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage\\nin any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt\\nagreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result\\nin an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\\nIn addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For\\nexample, it could:\\n•\\nmake  us  more  vulnerable  to adverse  changes  in  general  U.S. and  worldwide  economic,  industry  and  competitive  conditions  and adverse  changes  in\\ngovernment regulation;\\n•\\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\\n•\\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\\n52\\n•\\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and\\n•\\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.\\nFurther, the LIBOR is expected to be phased out as a benchmark by the end of 2021. If new methods of calculating LIBOR are established or if other\\nbenchmark rates used to price indebtedness or investments are established, the terms of any existing or future indebtedness or investments, including the terms of\\nFlexdrive’s debt instruments, may be negatively impacted, resulting in increased interest expense or lower than expected interest income.\\nIn addition, under certain of our and our subsidiary’s existing debt instruments, we and Flexdrive are subject to customary affirmative and negative\\ncovenants regarding our business and operations, including limitations on Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain\\nasset dispositions. If we or Flexdrive, as applicable, do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, and do not obtain a waiver or\\nconsent from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable. Any debt financing secured\\nby us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may\\nmake it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our\\ndebt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse\\neffect on our cash flows and liquidity.\\nAny of these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks\\nrelated to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\\nIn connection with the issuance of our 2025 Notes, we entered into the capped call transactions, or Capped Calls. The option counterparties are financial\\ninstitutions,  and  we  will  be  subject  to  the  risk  that  any  or  all  of  them  might  default  under  the  Capped  Calls.  Our  exposure  to  the  credit  risk  of  the  option\\ncounterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of\\nmany financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a\\nclaim equal to our exposure at that time under the Capped Calls with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an\\nincrease in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon a default by an\\noption counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can\\nprovide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.\\nGAAP is subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A\\nchange in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions\\ncompleted before the announcement of a change. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic\\n606), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our\\naccounting policies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations.\\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $6.2 billion of federal, $5.4 billion of state and $3.4 million of foreign net operating losses (“NOLs”) available to\\nreduce future taxable income, which will begin to expire in 2030 for federal, 2022 for state and 2037 for foreign tax purposes. It is possible that we will not\\ngenerate  taxable  income  in  time  to  use  NOLs  before  their  expiration,  or  at  all.  Under  Section  382  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended,  if  a\\ncorporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an\\n“ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-\\nyear period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our ability to use net operating loss to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to\\nannual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes that may occur in the future.\\nThe Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, among other things, includes changes to the rules\\ngoverning NOLs. NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 are subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation (as calculated before taking the\\nNOLs into account) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, NOLs arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are subject to a five year\\ncarryback and indefinite carryforward, while NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 also are subject to indefinite carryforward but cannot be\\ncarried back. Our NOLs may also be subject to limitations in other jurisdictions. For example, California recently enacted legislation suspending the use of NOLs\\nfor taxable years 2020, 2021, and 2022 for many taxpayers. In future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is recognized\\n53\\nrelated to our NOLs, the changes in the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our valuation\\nallowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2017.\\nRisks Related to Governance and Ownership of our Capital Stock Factors\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders, which will limit your ability to influence the\\noutcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\\nOur Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued\\nand outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Accordingly, Logan Green, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors\\nholds approximately 23.17% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and President and Vice Chair of our board of\\ndirectors, holds approximately 13.06% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, will be able to\\nsignificantly influence matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and\\nany merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our Co-Founders, individually or together, may have\\ninterests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the\\neffect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their\\ncapital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Each Co-Founder’s voting power is as of\\nDecember  31,  2020  and  includes  shares  of  Class  A  common  stock  expected  to  be  issued  upon  the  vesting  of  such  Co-Founder’s  RSUs  within  60  days  of\\nDecember 31, 2020.\\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to\\nlimited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into\\none share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Class B\\ncommon stock, (ii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the shares of\\nClass B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of the Class B common stock held\\nby our Co-Founders and their permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, or (iii) nine months after the\\ndeath or total disability of the last to die or become disabled of our Co-Founders, or such later date not to exceed a total period of 18 months after such death or\\ndisability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.\\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on our stock price.\\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse\\npublicity  or  other  adverse  consequences.  For  example,  certain  index  providers  have  announced  restrictions  on  including  companies  with  multiple-class  share\\nstructures in certain of their indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies\\nutilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and\\nS&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on\\ntheir treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices; however, in October 2018, MSCI\\nannounced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights\\nin its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our dual class capital structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual\\nfunds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are still\\nfairly new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible\\nthat they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companies that are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be\\nexcluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment\\nfunds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could\\nmake our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are\\nbeyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in\\nthe trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\\n•\\nprice and volume fluctuations  in the overall stock market from time to time, including fluctuations due to general economic uncertainty  or negative\\nmarket sentiment, in particular related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n54\\n•\\nvolatility  in  the  trading  prices  and  trading  volumes  of  technology  stocks  generally,  or  those  in  our  industry,  including  fluctuations  unrelated  or\\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of those technology companies;\\n•\\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\\n•\\nsales or purchases of shares of our Class A common stock by us, our officers, or our significant stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales or\\npurchases could occur;\\n•\\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to\\nmeet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\\n•\\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\\n•\\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features;\\n•\\ninvestor sentiment and the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC, or those of our competitors or\\nothers in our industry;\\n•\\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\\n•\\nshort selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;\\n•\\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\\n•\\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\\n•\\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\\n•\\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\\n•\\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;\\n•\\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\\n•\\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\\n•\\nany significant change in our management or our board of directors; and\\n•\\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class\\naction litigation has often been instituted against these companies. For example, as disclosed above, beginning in April 2019, several putative class actions have\\nbeen filed in California state and federal courts and a derivative action has been filed in Delaware federal court against us, our directors, certain of our officers, and\\ncertain of the underwriters named in our IPO Registration Statement alleging violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in\\nconnection with our IPO. Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them, such matters could result in\\nsubstantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales have or could occur, could depress the market price of our Class\\nA common stock.\\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market,\\nand the perception that these sales have or could occur may also depress the market price of our Class A common stock, including if there is short-selling or other\\nhedging transactions.\\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by them for public sale in the United States.\\nIn  addition,  we  filed  a  registration  statement  to  register  shares  reserved  for  future  issuance  under  our  equity  compensation  plans.  As  a  result,  subject  to  the\\nsatisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be\\navailable for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\\nSales  of  our  Class  A  common  stock  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  sell  equity  securities  in  the  future  at  a  time  and  at  a  price  that  we  deem\\nappropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A\\ncommon stock.\\n55\\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or\\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.\\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a\\nchange  in control  by prohibiting  us from  engaging in  a business  combination  with an interested  stockholder  for a period of three  years  after  the  date of  the\\ntransaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our\\namended  and  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  and  amended  and  restated  bylaws  contain  provisions  that  may  make  the  acquisition  of  our  company  more\\ndifficult, including the following:\\n•\\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws require the approval of at least two-thirds of\\nour then-outstanding voting power;\\n•\\nour dual class common stock structure, which provides our Co-Founders, individually or together, with the ability to significantly influence the outcome\\nof matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock and\\nClass B common stock;\\n•\\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for\\ncause;\\n•\\nour stockholders are only able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and are not able to take action by written consent for any matter;\\n•\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\\n•\\nvacancies on our board of directors are able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\\n•\\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or a\\nmajority of our board of directors;\\n•\\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\\n•\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which\\nmay be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\\n•\\nadvance  notice  procedures  apply  for  stockholders  to  nominate  candidates  for  election  as  directors  or  to  bring  matters  before  an  annual  meeting  of\\nstockholders.\\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions\\ncould also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions\\nthey desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A\\ncommon stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes\\nbetween us and our stockholders and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of\\naction arising under the Securities Act, each of which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,\\nofficers or employees.\\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law,\\nthe sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed\\nby any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation\\nLaw, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the\\ninternal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court\\nfor the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws\\nalso provide that the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the\\nSecurities Act.\\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these\\nprovisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our\\ndirectors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors,  officers  and other employees. If a court were to find the\\nexclusive-forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws\\n56\\nto be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our\\nresults of operations.\\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they change\\ntheir recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our\\nbusiness, our market or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If\\nany of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative recommendations\\nabout our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these\\nsecurities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets and demand for our securities\\ncould decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and\\nexpansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\\nA common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\\nItem 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled “Selected\\nConsolidated Financial and Other Data” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal years 2020 and 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of fiscal\\nyear 2018 and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those\\nidentified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not\\nnecessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\\nFinancial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2020\\n•\\nTotal revenue was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 35% year-over-year.\\n•\\nTotal costs and expenses were $4.2 billion, including stock-based compensation expense of $565.8 million and insurance costs related to changes to\\ninsurance reserves attributable to historical periods of $168.1 million.\\n•\\nLoss from operations was $1.8 billion.\\n•\\nNet loss was $1.8 billion.\\n•\\nCash used in operating activities was $1.4 billion.\\n•\\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2020.\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n60\\nImpact of COVID-19 to our Business\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. The spread of COVID-19 has\\ncaused public health officials to recommend and governments to enact precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, extensive social\\ndistancing measures and issuing “shelter-in-place” orders in many regions of the United States and Canada. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic\\nand these related responses have caused decreased demand for our platform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on\\nour platform, the global slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply\\nchains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. These impacts are ongoing and have continued into 2021.\\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although demand has improved compared to the second quarter of 2020, it\\nremains significantly below the prior year. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. As certain regions have reopened, some have experienced a\\nresurgence of COVID-19 cases and reimposed restrictions. The extent to which our operations will continue to be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on\\nfuture developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the\\npandemic, actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or recover from its impact, and the availability and distribution of the\\nvaccine, among other things. Even as travel restrictions have been and will continue to be modified or lifted, we anticipate that continued social distancing, altered\\nconsumer behavior, reduced travel and commuting and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration of these\\nchallenges cannot be presently estimated.\\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March and continuing into the first quarter of 2021, we have adopted multiple measures, including\\npausing our shared rides offerings, distributing thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer, masks and partitions to drivers on our platform, requiring face coverings on\\nall rideshare trips, providing most employees with the option to work from home at least until September 1, 2021, restricting non-critical business travel by our\\nemployees, and making adjustments to our expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenues. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, in an effort\\nto reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges resulting from the pandemic, we announced the following actions:\\n•\\nTermination of approximately 17% of our employees;\\n•\\nFurlough of approximately 300 employees;\\n•\\nImplementation of a reduction in base salary for exempt employees for 12 weeks, ranging from 10% for most non-hourly employees and up to\\n30% for our senior leadership team; and\\n•\\nMembers of our board of directors voluntarily agreeing to forego 30% of their cash compensation for the second quarter of 2020.\\nAs a result of these actions, we recognized a stock-based compensation benefit related to the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation\\nexpenses  for  unvested  stock  awards  of  $72.7  million  offset  by  a  charge  related  to  the  accelerated  vesting  of  certain  equity  awards  for  employees  who  were\\nterminated of $22.9 million. Additionally, we recognized other restructuring charges including severance and other employee costs of $32.1 million and lease\\ntermination and other restructuring charges of $3.1 million, resulting in a net benefit of $14.5 million in the second quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020,\\nwe terminated 45 employees in our continued efforts to reduce operating expenses resulting in an additional $1.4 million in net restructuring charges. However,\\nthese actions have and will only mitigate a limited portion of the negative effects of the pandemic on our business.\\nIn addition to the actions outlined above, we also significantly decreased our planned 2020 capital expenditure spending. We decreased rider incentives to\\nan all-time low in the second quarter of 2020 and maintained them near the historical low through the fourth quarter of 2020, resulting in a significant decrease in\\nsales and marketing expenses.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we also issued $747.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2025, or the 2025\\nNotes. In addition, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with the option counterparties at a cost of approximately $132.7 million. We\\nbelieve the net proceeds further improve our financial position for general corporate purposes and improve our ability to execute on capital expenditures, potential\\nacquisitions and strategic transactions as they arise.\\nWe remain confident in our ability to navigate this challenging time and continue to focus on our long-term growth opportunities and our business model,\\nincluding our ability to be profitable in the future. With $2.3 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2020,\\nwe  believe  we  have  sufficient  liquidity  to  continue  to  support  our  business  operations  and  to  take  strategic  investments  that  are  in  the  best  interests  of  our\\nemployees and other stakeholders. For more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled “Risk\\nFactors” in Item 1A of Part I.\\n61\\nRecent Developments – Driver Classification\\nOn November 3, 2020, California voters passed the ballot initiative, Proposition 22. Proposition 22 protects independence and flexibility, while providing\\nthem new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards health care coverage, occupational accident insurance, and minimum guaranteed\\nearnings. We have incurred additional expenses associated with these new earnings opportunities and protections. We do not expect these changes will have a\\nmaterial impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. See the sections titled “Legal Proceedings” and “Risk Factors” in Items 3\\nand 1A, respectively, of Part I for additional information.\\nActive Riders and Revenue per Active Rider\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decrease in Active Riders and in revenue per Active Rider, though we experienced a recovery in revenue\\nper Active Rider in the second half of 2020 as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of Active Riders. The number of Active Riders is a key indicator of the scale\\nof our community and awareness of our brand. Revenue per Active Rider represents our ability to drive usage and monetization of our platform.\\nActive Riders\\nRevenue per Active Rider\\n2020\\n2019\\nGrowth Rate\\n2020\\n2019\\nGrowth Rate\\n(in thousands, except for dollar amounts and percentages)\\nThree Months Ended March 31\\n21,211\\n20,503\\n3.5%\\n$45.06\\n$37.86\\n19.0%\\nThree Months Ended June 30\\n8,688\\n21,807\\n(60.1)%\\n$39.06\\n$39.77\\n(1.8)%\\nThree Months Ended September 30\\n12,513\\n22,314\\n(43.9)%\\n$39.94\\n$42.82\\n(6.7)%\\nThree Months Ended December 31\\n12,552\\n22,905\\n(45.2)%\\n$45.40\\n$44.40\\n2.3%\\nWe define Active Riders as all riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active Rider is\\nidentified by a unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers\\nduring the quarter, that person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person\\nwould be considered a single Active Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this\\nrider in the calculation of Active Riders. unless the ride is accessible in the Lyft App.\\nBeginning  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020, some  riders  were  able  to  access  their  Concierge  rides  in  the  Lyft  App if  they  already  had a  Lyft  account.\\nAccordingly, Lyft updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider’s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing\\nthe rider to access their ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to the\\nfourth quarter of 2020, all Concierge riders were excluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider\\naccounts.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we updated the definition of Active Riders to include riders who have migrated from the legacy Motivate platform to the\\nLyft Platform, which resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 1,167 Active Riders, in the fourth quarter. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2019, for Motivate, only\\nriders that had taken a ride or rented a bike or scooter through the Lyft App during the quarter were counted as an Active Rider. This change had no impact on the\\nActive Riders disclosed in any of the prior periods presented.\\nWith the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019, Active Riders in each of the three\\nmonth  periods  ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2020  was  down  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2019.  This  was  primarily  due  to  the\\nimplementation of travel restrictions and extensive social distancing measures across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020.\\nHowever, relative to the trough in Active Riders for the three months ended June 30, 2020, our Active Riders base increased during the three months ended\\nSeptember 30, 2020 and was stable during the three months ended December 31, 2020 despite the surge in COVID-19 cases and the reintroduction of restrictive\\nmeasures toward the end of the year. Local recovery trends continue to vary significantly.\\nRevenue per Active Rider for each of the three months ended June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020 was down compared to the same period in 2019\\nreflecting the decline in ride frequency as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, revenue per Active Rider reached an all time high in the three months\\nended December 31, 2020, reflecting a mix shift toward higher frequency Active Riders as new rider activations declined and lower frequency riders used the\\nplatform less often. Additions to our Active Rider base at the end of any quarter are generally dilutive to revenue per Active Rider for the quarter, which resulted in\\nincreased revenue per Active Rider this quarter. In the latter part of the fourth quarter, as COVID-19 cases surged and states and cities implemented restrictive\\nmeasures intended to curb the spread, ride demand also declined.\\nInitial Public Offering\\nOur IPO Registration Statement was declared effective on March 28, 2019 and our Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select\\nMarket on March 29, 2019. Our IPO was completed on April 2, 2019 and the partial exercise of the\\n62\\nunderwriters’ option to purchase additional shares was completed on April 9, 2019. Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 and for the year\\nthen-ended reflect the sale by us of an aggregate of 35,496,845 shares in our IPO, including pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase\\nadditional shares, at the public offering price of $72.00 per share, for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $2.5 billion, after underwriting discounts and\\ncommissions and offering expenses, and the conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into an aggregate of 219,175,709\\nshares of Class A common stock.\\nOur consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 and for the year then-ended reflect stock-based compensation expense of $1.6 billion\\nprimarily associated with the vesting of RSUs for which the requisite service condition was met as of December 31, 2019. The liquidity event condition for RSUs,\\nif any, was satisfied upon the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement on March 28, 2019.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance\\nwith GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\\nliabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to\\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates\\nand actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.\\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the\\nmost critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 of the\\nnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\\nWe generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We recognize revenue from fees paid by\\ndrivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Drivers\\nenter into terms of service (“ToS”) with us in order to use our Lyft Driver App.\\nWe provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists\\ndrivers to find, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a\\nresult, our single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for\\nriders.\\nWe evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service\\nprovided to the rider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation\\nservice by a driver to a rider (the driver’s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to\\nprovide a transportation service to their customer through use of the Lyft Platform. While we facilitate setting the price for transportation services, the drivers and\\nriders have the discretion in accepting the transaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do\\nwe have inventory risk related to the transportation services. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service\\nto a rider.\\nWe report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected\\nfrom the rider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract\\nwith drivers to provide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform,\\nand do not control the provision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.\\nWe consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract\\nexists between the driver and us when the driver’s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related\\ncharges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the\\nremaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.\\nWe earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the\\namount earned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare\\narrangement, as we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the\\ndriver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We earn a\\n63\\nvariable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-front quoted fare\\noffered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.\\nWe recognize revenue upon completion of a ride as the single performance obligation is satisfied and we have the right to receive payment for the\\nservices rendered upon the completion of the ride.\\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or\\nif we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\\nIn some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to\\nrequest rides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a\\npercentage of the ride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.\\nWe recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over\\nthe applicable subscription period.\\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\\nWe generate rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, our network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Under the Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals programs,\\nwe operate a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies (“head leases”). We either\\nlease or sublease vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, as a result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements\\nin accordance with ASC 842. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis in the\\nconsolidated financial statements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which we collect from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s\\nearnings on the Lyft Platform.\\nRevenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicles riders are recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from\\nFlexdrive and Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft\\nRentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, we classify these rentals as operating leases.\\nInsurance Reserves\\nWe utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to\\ninsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury\\nprotection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated ultimate cost for claims incurred but not\\npaid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim\\npayments. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including\\nconsideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party\\nactuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.\\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make\\ncertain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics and utilize actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number\\nof factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related\\nlitigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The\\nimpact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while we believe that the insurance reserve amount\\nis adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the\\nliability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets. We continue to review\\nour insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and the legal, regulatory\\nand economic environment evolves.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe incur stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (“PSUs”), stock options, and stock purchase rights\\ngranted under the our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).\\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-\\npricing model. The fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service\\nperiod. We recognize compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.\\n64\\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs are estimated based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to our IPO is\\ndetermined based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to our IPO, we granted RSUs which vest upon the\\nsatisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition.\\nCompensation expense for RSUs with service and performance conditions is amortized on a graded basis over the requisite service period as long as the\\nperformance condition in the form of a specified liquidity event is probable to occur. The liquidity event condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of our IPO\\nRegistration Statement on March 28, 2019. On that date we recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the accelerated\\nattribution method for the RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized  stock-based compensation\\nexpense related to these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which\\nvest upon satisfaction of a service-based condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2020, the total\\nunrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs was $905.6 million, which we expect to recognize over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately\\n2.4 years.\\nStock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time\\nof grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of\\npurchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the\\nfair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets\\nacquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based\\nupon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During\\nthe measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement\\nperiod, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as\\nincurred.\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill represents  the  excess of the purchase  price  over the fair  value  of the net tangible  and identifiable  intangible  assets acquired  in a business\\ncombination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by us based on the\\nfair value of assets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.\\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative\\nassessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of\\nthe reporting unit is less than its carrying amounts, the quantitative impairment test will be required. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years\\nended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee  Note  2  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  recently  issued  accounting\\npronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this report. \\nComponents of Results of Operations\\nAs noted above, we expect to see decreased levels of demand for our platform, decreased numbers of new rider activations, and negative impacts on\\nrevenue for so long as responsive measures to COVID-19 remain in place, and we have adopted multiple measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We\\ncannot be certain that these actions will mitigate some or all of the negative effects of the pandemic on our business. In light of the evolving and unpredictable\\neffects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financial and operating results in future periods.\\nRevenue\\nRevenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations that\\nuse our Concierge offering, and subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through\\n65\\nthe Lyft Platform. Revenue derived from these offerings are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 as described in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nabove and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue  also  consists  of  rental  revenues  recognized  through  leases  or  subleases  primarily  from  Flexdrive,  Lyft  Rentals,  and  our  network  of  Light\\nVehicles, which includes revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by riders of Light Vehicles. Revenue derived from these offerings are recognized in\\naccordance with ASC 842 as described in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or\\nif we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\\nCost of Revenue\\nCost of revenue consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through our multimodal platform which primarily includes insurance\\ncosts, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing and bike\\nand scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges.\\nOther  costs  included  in  cost  of  revenue  are  hosting  and  platform-related  technology  costs,  vehicle  lease  expenses,  personnel-related  compensation  costs,\\ndepreciation, amortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.\\nOperations and Support\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email\\nand chat support to users, bike and scooter fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, facility costs, certain car rental fleet\\nsupport costs and fees paid to third-parties providing operations support. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance,\\nand other customer support activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs related to\\ncertain of our autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or\\nriders, advertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that are\\ngenerally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative fees,\\npolicy spend, depreciation, facility costs and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.\\nInterest Expense\\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest incurred on our 2025 Notes, as well as the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and debt\\ndiscount. Interest expense also includes interest incurred on our Non-Revolving Loan and our Master Vehicle Loan.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, and restricted and unrestricted short-term investments.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nOur provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions and U.S. state income taxes. As we expand the scale of our\\ninternational business activities, any changes in the U.S. and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our overall provision for income taxes in the future.\\nWe have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. We expect to\\nmaintain this valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized by way of\\nexpected future taxable income in the United States.\\n66\\nResults of Operations\\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations data:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n(in thousands)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n2,364,681 \\n$\\n3,615,960 \\n$\\n2,156,616 \\nCosts and expenses\\nCost of revenue\\n1,447,516 \\n2,176,469 \\n1,243,400 \\nOperations and support\\n453,963 \\n636,116 \\n338,402 \\nResearch and development\\n909,126 \\n1,505,640 \\n300,836 \\nSales and marketing\\n416,331 \\n814,122 \\n803,751 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n946,127 \\n1,186,093 \\n447,938 \\nTotal costs and expenses\\n4,173,063 \\n6,318,440 \\n3,134,327 \\nLoss from operations\\n(1,808,382)\\n(2,702,480)\\n(977,711)\\nInterest expense\\n(32,678)\\n— \\n— \\nOther income, net\\n43,669 \\n102,595 \\n67,114 \\nLoss before income taxes\\n(1,797,391)\\n(2,599,885)\\n(910,597)\\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\\n(44,534)\\n2,356 \\n738 \\nNet loss\\n$\\n(1,752,857)\\n$\\n(2,602,241)\\n$\\n(911,335)\\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nRevenue\\n100.0 %\\n100.0 %\\n100.0 %\\nCosts and expenses\\nCost of revenue\\n61.2 \\n60.2 \\n57.6 \\nOperations and support\\n19.2 \\n17.6 \\n15.7 \\nResearch and development\\n38.4 \\n41.6 \\n13.9 \\nSales and marketing\\n17.6 \\n22.5 \\n37.3 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n40.0 \\n32.8 \\n20.8 \\nTotal costs and expenses\\n176.5 \\n174.7 \\n145.3 \\nLoss from operations\\n(76.5)\\n(74.7)\\n(45.3)\\nInterest expense\\n(1.4)\\n— \\n— \\nOther income, net\\n1.8 \\n2.8 \\n3.1 \\nLoss before income taxes\\n(76.0)\\n(71.9)\\n(42.2)\\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\\n(1.9)\\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\nNet loss\\n(74.1)%\\n(72.0)%\\n(42.3)%\\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\\nRevenue\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2018 to 2019 %\\nChange\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n2,364,681 \\n$\\n3,615,960 \\n$\\n2,156,616 \\n(35) %\\n68 %\\nRevenue decreased $1.3 billion, or 35%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year, driven primarily by a decrease in the number\\nof  Active  Riders  beginning  in  March  2020  and  continuing  throughout  2020  due  to  the  implementation  of  travel  restrictions  and  extensive  social  distancing\\nmeasures across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nWe expect to see continued suppression of demand for our platform and resulting negative impacts on revenue for so long as the travel restrictions,\\nextensive social distancing measures and other restrictive measures in response to COVID-19 remain in place\\n67\\nand we cannot predict when such measures may no longer be in place. Even as these measures and travel restrictions have been and will continue to be modified or\\nlifted, we cannot estimate the extent that continued social distancing, altered consumer behavior, reduced travel and commuting and expected corporate cost cutting\\nwill impact our business.\\nCost of Revenue\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2018 to 2019 %\\nChange\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n1,447,516 \\n$\\n2,176,469 \\n$\\n1,243,400 \\n(33) %\\n75 %\\nCost of revenue decreased $729.0 million, or 33%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was due primarily to\\na  decrease  of  $371.7  million  in  insurance  costs  driven  by  (i)  the  negative  impact  on  ride  volume  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  (ii)  a  decrease  of\\n$51.0 million in changes to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods. The lower ride volume due to the COVID-\\n19 pandemic also resulted in decreases in transaction fees and web hosting fees to support our platform of $186.0 million and $43.4 million, respectively. Bike and\\nscooter  related  costs  also  decreased  $48.6  million  as  a  result  of  a  reduction  in  asset  disposals  and  a  reduction  in  depreciation  expenses  due  to  lower  capital\\nexpenditures in response to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, stock-based compensation expense decreased $48.4 million, primarily\\nattributable to (i) the use of the accelerated attribution method to recognize expenses for RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement\\nwhich resulted in higher stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) the stock-based compensation benefit related to the\\nrestructuring in the second quarter of 2020.\\nOperations and Support\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2018 to 2019 %\\nChange\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nOperations and support\\n$\\n453,963 \\n$\\n636,116 \\n$\\n338,402 \\n(29) %\\n88 %\\nOperations and support expenses decreased $182.2 million, or 29%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. The decrease\\nwas primarily due to a reduction of $64.6 million in driver onboarding costs and rider and driver support costs as well as a reduction of $16.9 million in facilities\\ncosts as a result of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Personnel-related costs also decreased $32.2 million primarily as a result of the restructuring in\\nthe  second  quarter  of  2020.  In  addition,  stock-based  compensation  expense  decreased  $56.6  million,  primarily  attributable  to  (i)  the  use  of  the  accelerated\\nattribution method to recognize expenses for RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement which resulted in higher stock-based\\ncompensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) the stock-based compensation benefit related to the restructuring in the second quarter of\\n2020.\\nResearch and Development\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2018 to 2019 %\\nChange\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nResearch and development\\n$\\n909,126 \\n$\\n1,505,640 \\n$\\n300,836 \\n(40) %\\n400 %\\nResearch and development expenses decreased $596.5 million, or 40%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. The decrease\\nwas primarily due to a $609.6 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense primarily attributable to (i) the use of the accelerated attribution method to\\nrecognize expenses for RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement which resulted in higher stock-based compensation expense for\\nthe year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) the stock-based compensation benefit related to the restructuring in the second quarter of 2020. The decrease was\\npartially offset by an increase of $47.0 million in autonomous vehicles research and development costs primarily due to the absence of\\n68\\nreimbursements  from  a  co-development  partnership  which  concluded  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2019.

The decrease was\\ndue to a $246.5 million decrease in costs related to incentive programs driven primarily by a reduction in rider incentives beginning in the second quarter of 2020\\nthrough the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $36.3 million in costs associated with driver and rider acquisition and a decrease of $31.9 million in brand and\\nother marketing. Personnel-related costs also decreased $12.2 million primarily as a result of the restructuring in the second quarter of 2020. The decrease was also\\ndue to a $47.1 million  reduction  in stock-based  compensation  expense primarily  attributable  to (i) the use of  the accelerated  attribution  method to recognize\\nexpenses for RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement which resulted in higher stock-based compensation expense for the year\\nended December 31, 2019, and (ii) the stock-based compensation benefit related to the restructuring in the second quarter of 2020.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2018 to 2019 %\\nChange\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nGeneral and administrative\\n$\\n946,127 \\n$\\n1,186,093 \\n$\\n447,938 \\n(20) %\\n165 %\\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $240.0 million, or 20%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. The decrease\\nwas due primarily to a $222.7 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense primarily attributable to (i) the use of the accelerated attribution method to\\nrecognize expenses for RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement which resulted in higher stock-based compensation expense for\\nthe year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) the stock-based compensation benefit related to the restructuring events in 2020. There was also a $50.0 million\\ndecrease  in  the  accrual  of  self-retained  general  business  liabilities  and  a  decrease  of  $23.5  million  in  certain  loss  contingencies  including  legal  accruals  and\\nsettlements. These decreases were partially offset by $44.6 million in policy spend in support of the passage of Proposition 22 in California and an increase of\\n$28.5 million in consultant and advisory costs.\\nInterest Expense\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2018 to 2019 %\\nChange\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nInterest expense\\n$\\n(32,678)\\n$\\n— \\n$\\n— \\n— %\\n— %\\nInterest expense increased $32.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to prior years.

For more information regarding our use of these\\nmeasures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\\nContribution and Contribution Margin\\nContribution and Contribution Margin are measures used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. We\\nbelieve Contribution and Contribution Margin are key measures of our ability to achieve profitability and increase it over time. Contribution Margin has generally\\nincreased over the periods presented as revenue has increased at a faster rate than the costs included in the calculation of Contribution.\\nWe define Contribution as revenue less cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude the following items from cost of revenue:\\n•\\namortization of intangible assets;\\n•\\nstock-based compensation expense;\\n•\\npayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\\n•\\nchanges to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\\n•\\ntransfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities; and\\n•\\nrestructuring charges, if any.\\nFor more information about cost of revenue, see the section titled “Components of Results of Operations—Cost of Revenue.”\\nContribution Margin is calculated by dividing Contribution for a period by revenue for the same period.\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n71\\nWe record historical changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies for financial reporting purposes in the quarter of positive or\\nadverse development even though such development may be related to claims that occurred in prior periods. For example, if in the first quarter of a given year, the\\ncost of claims grew by $1 million for claims related to the prior fiscal year or earlier, the expense would be recorded for GAAP purposes within the first quarter\\ninstead of in the results of the prior period. We believe these prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our\\nongoing operations since these prior period changes relate  to claims that could potentially  date back years. We have limited  ability to influence the ultimate\\ndevelopment of historical claims. Accordingly, including the prior period changes would not illustrate the performance of our ongoing operations or how the\\nbusiness  is  run  or  managed  by  us.  For  consistency,  we  do  not  adjust  the  calculation  of  Contribution  for  any  prior  period  based  on  any  positive  or  adverse\\ndevelopment  that  occurs  subsequent  to  the  quarter  end.  Annual  Contribution  is  calculated  by  adding  Contribution  of  the  last  four  quarters.  We  believe  the\\nadjustment to exclude the historical changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies from Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to\\ninvestors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period results.\\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a Novation Agreement for the transfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities between October 1,\\n2015 and September 30, 2018. Refer to Note 5 “Supplemental Financial Statement Information” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding\\nthis transaction. We believe the costs associated with the transfer of these legacy auto insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our\\nongoing operations despite this transaction occurring in the current period because these costs are non-recurring and the transferred insurance liabilities relate to\\nclaims that date back years. We believe the adjustment to exclude these costs related to the transfer of legacy insurance liabilities from Contribution and Adjusted\\nEBITDA  is  useful  to  investors  by  enabling  them  to  better  assess  our  operating  performance  in  the  context  of  current  period  results  and  provide  for  better\\ncomparability with our historically disclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA amounts.\\nWe  had  restructuring  efforts  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  2020  to  reduce  operating  expenses  and  adjust  cash  flows  in  light  of  the  ongoing\\neconomic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business. We believe the costs associated with the restructuring do not reflect\\ncurrent period performance of our ongoing operations. We believe the adjustment to exclude the costs related to restructuring from Contribution and Adjusted\\nEBITDA  is  useful  to  investors  by  enabling  them  to  better  assess  our  operating  performance  in  the  context  of  current  period  results  and  provide  for  better\\ncomparability with our historically disclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA amounts.\\nFor more information regarding the limitations of Contribution and Contribution Margin and a reconciliation of revenue to Contribution, see the section\\ntitled \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the\\noperating  leverage  in  our  business.  Because  Adjusted  EBITDA  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  Margin  facilitate  internal  comparisons  of  our  historical  operating\\nperformance on a more consistent basis, we use these measures for business planning purposes. We expect Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin will\\nincrease over the long term as we continue to scale our business and achieve greater efficiencies in our operating expenses.\\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted to exclude:\\n•\\ninterest expense;\\n•\\nother income (expense), net;\\n•\\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes;\\n•\\ndepreciation and amortization;\\n•\\nstock-based compensation expense;\\n•\\npayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\\n•\\nchanges to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\\n•\\ncosts related to acquisitions, if any;\\n•\\ntransfer of the certain legacy auto insurance liability; and\\n•\\nrestructuring charges, if any.\\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period.\\nFor more information regarding the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA,\\nsee the section titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\\n72\\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nWe use Contribution, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall\\nassessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business\\nstrategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other\\ncompanies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these measures have\\ncertain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run\\nour  business.  Thus,  our  Contribution,  Contribution  Margin,  Adjusted  EBITDA  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  Margin  should  be  considered  in  addition  to,  not  as\\nsubstitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\nWe  compensate  for  these  limitations  by  providing  a  reconciliation  of  Contribution  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  to  the  related  GAAP  financial  measures,\\nrevenue and net loss, respectively. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure\\nand to view Contribution, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with their respective related GAAP financial\\nmeasures.\\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of revenue to Contribution (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n(in millions)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n2,364.7 \\n$\\n3,616.0 \\n$\\n2,156.6 \\nLess: cost of revenue\\n(1,447.5)\\n(2,176.5)\\n(1,243.4)\\nAdjusted to exclude the following (as related to cost of revenue):\\nAmortization of intangible assets\\n12.0 \\n19.5 \\n3.7 \\nStock-based compensation\\n28.7 \\n81.4 \\n0.5 \\nPayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation\\n1.5 \\n1.8 \\n— \\nChanges to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical\\nperiods\\n204.1 \\n270.3 \\n3.4 \\nTransfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities\\n62.5 \\n— \\n— \\nRestructuring charges\\n3.5 \\n— \\n— \\nContribution\\n$\\n1,229.5 \\n$\\n1,812.5 \\n$\\n920.8 \\n_______________\\n(1)\\n$204.1 million of insurance expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects changes to reserves estimates of claims from the third quarter of 2020 and earlier\\nperiods. $270.3 million of insurance expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects changes to reserves estimates of claims from the third quarter of 2019 and\\nearlier periods. $3.4 million of insurance expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects changes to reserves estimates of claims from the third quarter of 2018 and\\nearlier periods.\\n(2)\\nThe total impact of the transfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities on our consolidated statement of operations was $64.7 million, with $62.5 million in cost of revenue and\\n$2.2 million in general and administrative expense.\\n(3)\\nIncluded in restructuring charges is $2.0 million of severance and other employee costs and $1.5 million of other restructuring charges.

Cash and cash equivalents consisted of institutional\\nmoney market funds, certificates  of deposits, commercial paper and corporate bonds that have an original maturity of less than three months and are readily\\nconvertible into known amounts of cash. Also included in cash and cash equivalents are certain money market deposit accounts and cash in transit from payment\\nprocessors for credit and debit card transactions. Short-term investments consisted of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and term deposits,\\nwhich mature in 12 months or less. Restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments consisted primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted\\nbank accounts as collateral for insurance purposes and amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.\\nWe collect the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers at the time the ride is delivered using the rider’s authorized payment method, and\\nwe retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement to drivers. Accordingly, we maintain no accounts receivable from drivers. Our contracts\\nwith  insurance  providers  require  reinsurance  premiums  to  be  deposited  into  trust  accounts  with  a  third-party  financial  institution  from  which  the  insurance\\nproviders are reimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion,\\nrespectively.\\nWe continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in March 2020, the pandemic and responses thereto contributed to a\\nsevere decrease in the number of rides on our platform and revenue which had a significant effect on our cash flows from operations. These impacts are ongoing\\nand  have  continued  into  2021.The  extent  to  which  our  operations,  financial  results  and  financial  condition  will  be  impacted  in  the  next  few  quarters  by  the\\npandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may\\nemerge concerning the severity of the pandemic, actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or recover from its impact, and\\nthe availability and distribution of the vaccine, among other things. We have adopted several measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including pausing\\nour shared ride offerings, distributing thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer, masks and partitions to drivers on our platform, providing most employees with the\\noption to work from home until September 1, 2021, restricting non-critical business travel by our employees, and making adjustments to our expenses and cash\\nflow to correlate with declines in revenues. On\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n(5)\\n74\\nApril  29,  2020.  we  announced  a  restructuring  plan  which  included  the  termination  of  approximately  17%  of  our  employees,  furlough  approximately  300\\nemployees,  and  implement  temporary  salary  reductions  for  all  exempt  employees  and board  members.  In  connection  with  these  decisions,  we incurred  a net\\nrestructuring benefit of $14.5 million in the second quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had an additional restructuring plan which included the\\ntermination of 45 employees in our continued efforts to reduce operating expenses resulting in an additional $1.4 million in net restructuring charges. In addition,\\nwe have also implemented an aggressive plan to strengthen our financial position. For example, we significantly decreased our 2020 capital expenditure spending\\nfrom our original plan and exceeded our target cost reductions in 2020 by 20%. We also decreased rider incentives to an all-time low in the second quarter of 2020\\nand maintained them near the historical low through the fourth quarter of 2020, resulting in a significant decrease in sales and marketing expenses.\\nIn  May  2020,  we  issued  $747.5  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of  our  2025  Notes.  The  net  proceeds  from  this  offering  were  approximately\\n$733.2 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and debt issuance costs. In connection with the issuance of our 2025 Notes, we\\nentered into the Capped Calls at a cost of approximately $132.7 million.\\nWe cannot be certain that our actions will mitigate some or all of the negative effects of the pandemic on our business. With nearly $2.3 billion in\\nunrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2020, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital\\nand capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months.\\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability to attract and retain drivers and riders on\\nour platform, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, actual insurance\\npayments for which we have made reserves, measures we take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to maintain demand for and confidence in the\\nsafety of our platform during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. As noted above, we expect to see\\ncontinued suppression of demand for our platform and the resultant negative impacts on revenue for so long as the travel restrictions and other social distancing\\nmeasures in response to COVID-19 remain in place. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services and\\ntechnologies. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing\\noperations, or to refinance our existing or future indebtedness. In the event that we decide, or are required, to seek additional financing from outside sources, we\\nmay not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition and results\\nof operations could be adversely affected.\\nCash Flows\\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n(in thousands)\\nNet cash used in operating activities\\n$\\n(1,378,899)\\n$\\n(105,702)\\n$\\n(280,673)\\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\\n740,427 \\n(1,610,843)\\n(1,043,752)\\nNet cash provided by financing activities\\n512,566 \\n1,574,196 \\n852,238 \\nEffect of foreign exchange on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents\\n(74)\\n328 \\n(246)\\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n(125,980)\\n$\\n(142,021)\\n$\\n(472,433)\\nOperating Activities\\nCash used in operating activities was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. This consisted primarily of a net loss of $1.8 billion and a\\ndecrease in the insurance reserve of $391.4 million primarily related to the transfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities in the first quarter of 2020. This was\\noffset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $565.8 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $157.4 million.\\nCash used in operating activities was $105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This consisted primarily of a net loss of $2.6 billion offset by\\nnon-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.6 billion largely driven by the recognition of costs related to RSUs which we started to recognize upon the\\neffectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement on March 28, 2019. Additionally, there was an increase in insurance reserves and accrued and other liabilities of\\n$0.9 billion.\\nCash used in operating activities was $280.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This consisted of a net loss of $911.3 million, an increase in\\nprepaid expenses and other assets of $75.6 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $40.8 million due to the timing of payments, partially offset by an\\nincrease in insurance reserves and accrued and other liabilities of $741.9 million.\\n75\\nInvesting Activities\\nCash provided by investing activities was $740.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of proceeds from sales and\\nmaturities of marketable securities of $5.4 billion and maturities of term deposits of $645.6 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $4.1\\nbillion and term deposits of $1.1 billion.\\nCash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily consisted of purchases of short-term investments\\nof $6.4 billion, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $5.2 billion.\\nCash used in investing activities was $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, which primarily consisted of purchases of short-term investments\\nof $5.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $4.7 billion.\\nFinancing Activities\\nCash provided by financing activities was $512.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of proceeds from issuance of\\nour 2025 Notes of $734.1 million offset by the purchase of the Capped Calls for $132.7 million.\\nCash provided by financing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of\\nour Class A common stock in our IPO of $2.5 billion, partially offset by taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of $0.9 billion.\\nCash provided by financing activities was $852.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which consisted almost exclusively of proceeds from\\nissuances of redeemable convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs.\\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\\nPayments Due by Period\\nTotal\\nLess than 1 Year\\n1-3 Years\\n3-5 Years\\nMore than\\n5 Years\\nOperating lease commitments\\n$\\n394.3 \\n$\\n72.3 \\n$\\n130.2 \\n$\\n94.6 \\n$\\n97.2 \\nFinancing lease commitments\\n28.0 \\n21.1 \\n5.7 \\n1.2 \\n— \\nNoncancelable purchase commitments\\n232.0 \\n28.0 \\n167.0 \\n17.9 \\n19.1 \\nLong-term debt, including current maturities\\n680.0 \\n35.8 \\n75.4 \\n568.8 \\n— \\n_______________\\n(1)\\nThe table excludes insurance reserves due to uncertainties in the timing of settlement of these reserves.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with\\nunconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for\\nthe purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\\n(1)\\n76\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates. Such fluctuations to date\\nhave not been significant.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $2.3 billion, which consisted primarily\\nof institutional money market funds, certificates of deposits, commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government and agency securities, and term deposits, which\\neach carry a degree of interest rate risk, and restricted cash, cash equivalents and restricted investments of $1.2 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates\\nwould not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had long-term debt of $680.0 million, 84% of which consisted of the fixed-rate Convertible Senior Notes we issued in May\\n2020. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to immateriality.\\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs were to\\nbecome subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business,\\nresults of operations or financial condition.\\n77\\nItem 8.

We also have audited the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal\\nControl - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity\\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\\nCOSO.\\nChange in Accounting Principle\\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,\\nand  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management’s  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial\\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain\\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective\\ninternal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur  audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated\\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\\ntesting  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.  Our  audits  also  included  performing  such  other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\\nfinancial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in\\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n79\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe  critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  that  was\\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial\\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\\nAs  described  in  Note  2  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  utilizes  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  and  third-party\\ninsurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto\\nphysical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, insurance reserves totaled $987 million. Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and\\nindustry  statistics,  with  the  most  significant  assumption  being  the  loss  development  factor  applied  in  the  actuarial  models  and  utilizes  actuarial  models  and\\ntechniques to estimate the reserves. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including\\nconsideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are\\n(i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity,\\nand effort in performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves; (ii) the significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence\\nrelated to the actuarial valuation methods and the loss development factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and\\nknowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves, including the controls over the\\ndevelopment of the actuarial valuation methods and the loss development factors. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals\\nwith specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the insurance reserves for certain reserve segments and comparison of this\\nindependent estimate to management’s actuarially determined reserves. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of\\nhistorical data provided by management, and independently developing loss development factors.\\n/s/

Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\\nOrganization and Description of Business\\nLyft, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. The Company operates multimodal transportation networks in\\nthe United States and Canada that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based applications. This network\\nenables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers who have a vehicle with riders who need a\\nride. The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where drivers can be matched with riders via the Lyft App where the Company operates as a TNC.\\nTransportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that\\nconnects drivers and riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada, Lyft’s network of shared bikes and scooters, the Express Drive program\\nwhich is a flexible vehicle rental program for drivers who want to drive using the Lyft Platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets Lyft\\'s requirements,\\nand Lyft Rentals, a consumer offering for users who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use.\\nTransfer of Certain Legacy Auto Liability Insurance\\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. (“PVIC”), entered into a Novation Agreement (the\\n“Novation”) with Clarendon National Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Enstar Group Limited (“Clarendon”), and certain underwriting companies of Zurich\\nNorth America (“Zurich”). Pursuant to the terms of the Novation, on the effective date March 31, 2020, the obligations of PVIC as reinsurer to Zurich for certain\\nlegacy auto liability insurance business underwritten between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2018 (\"Legacy Auto Liability\"), were assigned to, assumed by,\\nand novated to Clarendon, for cash consideration of $465.0 million. The Company paid the $465.0 million cash consideration to Clarendon. In conjunction with the\\nNovation, Clarendon and PVIC executed a binding letter of intent to enter into an Excess of Loss Retrocession Agreement (“Retrocession Agreement”). Refer to\\nNote 5 “Supplemental Financial Statement Information” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThese  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  (U.S.\\nGAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nThe Company uses the U.S. dollar predominantly as the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries. For foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is\\nthe  functional  currency,  gains  and  losses  from  remeasurement  of  foreign  currency  balances  into  U.S.  dollars  are  included  in  the  consolidated  statements  of\\noperations. For the foreign subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into U.S.\\ndollars are recorded to a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\\nInitial Public Offering\\nThe Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (the “IPO Registration Statement”) related to its initial public offering (“IPO”) was declared effective\\non March 28, 2019, and the Company’s Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 29, 2019. On April 2, 2019, the\\nCompany completed its IPO, in which the Company sold 32,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $72.00 per share. On April 9,\\n2019, the Company sold an additional 2,996,845 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $72.00 per share pursuant to the exercise of the\\nunderwriters’  option  to  purchase  additional  shares.  The  Company  received  aggregate  net  proceeds  of  $2.5  billion  after  deducting  underwriting  discounts  and\\ncommissions of $70.3 million and offering expenses of $7.7 million subject to certain cost reimbursements.\\nImmediately  prior  to  the  completion  of  the  IPO,  219,175,709  shares  of  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  then  outstanding  converted  into  an\\nequivalent  number of  shares of common stock.  Immediately  prior to the completion  of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate  of\\nIncorporation,  which  authorizes  a  total  of  18,000,000,000  shares  of  Class  A  common  stock,  100,000,000  shares  of  Class  B  common  stock,\\nand 1,000,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Upon the filing of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 255,007,393 shares of the Company’s\\ncommon stock then outstanding were automatically reclassified into an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. Immediately after\\nthe reclassification and prior to the completion of the IPO, a total of 12,779,709 shares of Class A common stock held by Logan Green, John Zimmer and their\\nrespective affiliated trusts were exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As\\na result, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has two classes of authorized and outstanding common stock: Class A common stock and Class B\\ncommon stock.\\n88\\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported\\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of\\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to,\\nhistory and prior experience, expected future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying\\nvalue of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\nSignificant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial instruments,\\ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets, leases, indirect tax obligations, legal contingencies, valuation allowance for deferred income taxes, and the valuation of\\nstock-based compensation.\\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, and has spread throughout in\\nthe United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. The full extent to which the Company\\'s operations will be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\\nwill  depend  largely  on  future  developments,  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  be  accurately  predicted,  including  the  duration  of  the  pandemic,  new\\ninformation which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or\\nrespond to its impact, among other things. The Company has adopted several measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including pausing our shared rides\\nofferings,  distributing  thousands  of  bottles  of  hand  sanitizer,  masks  and  partitions  to  drivers,  requiring  face  coverings  in  all  rideshare  trips,  providing  most\\nemployees with the option to work from home until September 1, 2021, restricting non-critical business travel by employees, and making adjustments to expenses\\nand  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenue.  The  Company  carried  out  two  restructuring  events  in  2020,  one  which  involved  the  termination  of\\napproximately 17% of its employees, furlough of approximately 300 employees and temporary salary reductions for all exempt employees and board members.\\nRefer to Note 17 “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding these restructuring events. The Company cannot be certain that\\nthese actions will mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on our business. As of the date of issuance of the financial statements, the Company is not aware of\\nany material event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates, judgments, or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities, including the\\nrecording of any credit losses. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and could lead to impairment of long lived\\nassets or goodwill, or credit losses associated with investments or other assets, and the impact of such changes on estimates will be recognized in the consolidated\\nfinancial statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our financial\\nstatements.\\nSegment Information\\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the\\nChief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief\\nExecutive  Officer  is  the  Company’s  CODM.  The  CODM  reviews  financial  information  presented  on  a  consolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating\\ndecisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment. During the\\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the\\nCompany did not have material assets located outside of the United States.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nThe Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft\\nPlatform and mobile-based applications. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is generated from its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders\\nand is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”). The Company also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive, its\\nnetwork of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals, which is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (“ASC 842”).\\nThe table below presents the Company\\'s revenues as included in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nRevenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606)\\n$\\n2,208,656 $\\n3,465,473 \\n$\\n2,106,021 \\nRental revenue (ASC 842)\\n156,025 \\n150,487 \\n50,595 \\nTotal revenue\\n$\\n2,364,681 $\\n3,615,960 \\n$\\n2,156,616 \\n89\\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\\nThe Company recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606. The Company generates revenue from service fees and\\ncommissions (collectively, “fees”) paid by drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully\\ncomplete rides via the App where the Company operates as a TNC. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of each ride. Drivers enter into terms of\\nservice (“ToS”) with the Company in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration\\nfor their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an\\nagent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the\\nCompany from a driver as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from the rider.\\nAs the Company’s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver’s ability to cancel the ride lapses,\\nwhich typically is upon pickup of the rider. The Company’s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the\\ncompletion of a successful transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied\\nupon the completion of the ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or\\nother payment mechanism and retains its fees before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to\\nsignificant judgment.\\nThe Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications\\nover the applicable subscription period in accordance with ASC 606.\\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\\nThe Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Rental revenues are recognized for\\nrental and rental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with\\nASC 842.\\nUnder the Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals programs, the Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by the Company and\\nvehicles leased from third-party leasing companies (“head leases”). The Company either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a\\nresult, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating\\ncosts include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs, as applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and\\nhead lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees,\\nwhich the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft Platform.\\nDue to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases.\\nRevenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive\\nand Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less.\\nEnterprise and Trade Receivables\\nThe Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider’s authorized payment method. Uncollected\\nfees are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and represent receivables from (i) participants in the Company’s\\nenterprise programs (“Enterprise Users”), where the transactions have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have either been invoiced\\nor are unbilled as of the reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not yet settled with third-\\nparty payment processors. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related\\nactivities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers. The\\nportion of the fare receivable to be remitted to drivers is included in accrued and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected. As a result of the\\nadoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses\" (“ASC 326”), the Company’s measurement of the allowance for\\ncredit losses has been augmented to reflect the change from the incurred loss model to the expected credit loss model. The allowance for credit losses reflects the\\nCompany’s  current  estimate  of  expected  credit  losses  inherent  in  the  enterprise  and  trade  receivables  balance.  In  determining  the  expected  credit  losses,  the\\nCompany considers its historical loss experience, the aging of its receivable balance, current economic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic\\nevents  that  may  impact  collectability.  The  Company  reviews  its  allowance  for  credit  losses  periodically  and  as  needed,  and  amounts  are  written  off  when\\ndetermined to be uncollectible.\\nThe Company’s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $104.7 million, $120.0 million and $100.5\\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company\\'s allowance for credit losses\\n90\\nwas $15.2 million, $6.2 million and $2.6 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the allowance for credit losses for the year\\nended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs. The change in the\\nallowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million\\nof write-offs. The change in the allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to $3.9 million of additions for provision for\\nexpected credit losses and $1.3 million of write-offs.\\nIncentive Programs\\nThe Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive\\ncash incentives while riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters generally receive free or discounted rides under such incentive programs. Incentives\\nprovided to drivers, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the\\nriders are not the Company’s customers, incentives provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs\\ndescribed below.\\nDriver Incentives\\nThe Company offers various incentive programs to drivers, including minimum guaranteed payments, volume-based discounts and performance-based\\nbonus payments. These driver incentives are similar to retrospective volume-based rebates and represent variable consideration that is typically settled within a\\nweek. The Company reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by\\napplying the most likely outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to\\nrevenue if the Company does not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service\\nreceived. Driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of\\nthe amount of the payment or the established fair value of the benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for\\nsimilar services.\\nRideshare Rider Incentives\\nThe  Company  has  several  rideshare  rider  incentive  programs,  which  are  offered  to  encourage  rider  activity  on  the  Lyft  Platform.  Generally,  the\\nrider incentive programs are as follows:\\n(i)\\nMarket-wide marketing promotions. Market-wide promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific\\nmarket. This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare\\ncharged  by  the  driver  to  the  rider,  and  thereby  results  in  a  lower  fee  earned  by  the  Company.  Accordingly,  the  Company  records  this  type\\nof incentive as a reduction to revenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.\\n(ii)\\nTargeted marketing promotions. Targeted marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders. An\\nexample is a promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a\\nlimited period of time to a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a\\nlimited number of rides are similar to marketing coupons. These incentives differ from the market-wide marketing promotions because they do not\\nreduce  the  overall  pricing  of  the  service  provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.  During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an\\nincentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.  These  incentives  represent  marketing  costs.  When  a  rider  redeems  the  incentive,  the  Company\\nrecognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of the incentive is recorded as sales and marketing expense.\\n(iii)\\nRider referral programs. Under the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee)\\ncompletes their first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with\\nthe  corresponding  charge  recorded  to  sales  and  marketing  expense.  Referral  coupons  typically  expire  within  one  year.  The  Company  estimates\\nbreakage using its historical experience. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.\\nLight Vehicle Rider and Lyft Rentals Renter Incentives\\nIncentives offered to Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, in relation to the driver, rider, Light Vehicle rider and Lyft Rental renter incentive programs, the\\nCompany recorded $390.8 million, $560.3 million and $555.4 million as a reduction to revenue and $135.0 million, $381.5 million and $299.2 million as sales and\\nmarketing expense, respectively.\\n91\\nRefunds\\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to riders unsatisfied by the level of service provided by the driver. There is no legal obligation to\\nremunerate such riders nor does the Company issue such credits or refunds to riders on behalf of the drivers. The Company accounts for credits or refunds, which\\nare not recoverable from the drivers as sales and marketing expenses when incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, rider refunds were\\n$18.8 million, $33.9 million and $41.8 million, respectively. The credits and refunds for Light Vehicle riders were not material for the years ended December 31,\\n2020, 2019 and 2018.\\nCost of Revenue\\nCost of revenue consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through the Company’s multimodal platform which primarily includes\\ninsurance  costs,  payment  processing  charges,  and  other  costs.  Insurance  costs  consist  of  insurance  generally  required  under  TNC  and  city  regulations  for\\nridesharing  and  bike  and  scooter  rentals  and  also  includes  occupational  hazard  insurance  for  drivers.  Payment  processing  charges  include  merchant  fees,\\nchargebacks and failed charges. Other costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, vehicle lease expenses, personnel-\\nrelated compensation costs, depreciation, amortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of\\nvehicles.\\nOperations and Support\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email\\nand chat support to users, bike and scooter fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, facility cost, certain car rental fleet\\nsupport costs, and fees paid to third-parties providing operations support. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance,\\nand other customer support activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs related to\\nthe Company’s autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or\\nriders, advertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses\\nwere $102.5 million, $188.3 million and $352.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that are\\ngenerally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative fees,\\npolicy spend, depreciation, facility costs, and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThe Company incurs stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, PSUs, stock options, and ESPP purchase rights.\\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes\\noption-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards. These variables\\ninclude:\\n•\\nper share fair value of the underlying common stock;\\n•\\nexercise price;\\n•\\nexpected term;\\n•\\nrisk-free interest rate;\\n•\\nexpected annual dividend yield; and\\n•\\nexpected stock price volatility over the expected term.\\n92\\nThe Company estimates the expected term for stock options using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” stock option awards. The expected term of the\\nESPP purchase rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period. Since the Company has limited\\nhistory as a public company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company\\'s common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options\\nand ESPP purchase rights using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield\\navailable on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted.\\nThe fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.\\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to\\nthe IPO is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to the IPO, the Company granted\\nRSUs which vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition.\\nCompensation expense for RSUs with service and performance conditions is amortized on a graded basis over the requisite service period as long as the\\nperformance condition in the form of a specified liquidity event is probable to occur. The liquidity event condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the IPO\\nRegistration Statement on March 28, 2019. On that date the Company recorded a cumulative  stock-based compensation  expense of $857.2 million using the\\naccelerated  attribution  method  for  the  RSUs  for  which  the  service  condition  was  satisfied  as  of  March  28,  2019.  The  remaining  unrecognized  stock-based\\ncompensation expense related to these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March\\n28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction of a service-based condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\\nStock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time\\nof grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded\\nbased on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are\\nmeasured  using  the  enacted  statutory  tax  rates  that  are  expected  to  apply  to  taxable  income  for  the  years  in  which  differences  are  expected  to  reverse.  The\\nCompany recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation\\nallowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence,\\nboth  positive  and  negative,  including  historical  levels  of  income,  expectations  and  risks  associated  with  estimates  of  future  taxable  income  and  ongoing  tax\\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\\nUnder the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates  uncertain  tax positions by reviewing against  applicable  tax law for all\\npositions taken by the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain\\ntax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or\\nlitigation processes, based on the technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a\\ncomponent of the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the\\nfair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The\\nexcess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair\\nvalue  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed,  management  makes  significant  estimates  and  assumptions,  especially  with  respect  to  intangible  assets.\\nManagement’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result,\\nactual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments\\nto the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed\\nas of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive\\nloss. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\\n93\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as well as commercial paper and\\ncorporate bonds. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to known\\namounts  of  cash.  Also  included  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  are  cash  in  transit  from  payment  processors  for  credit  and  debit  card  transactions,  which  was\\nimmaterial as of each of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and money market deposit accounts that are stated at cost, which approximate fair value.\\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance\\npurposes and amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.\\nInvestments\\nDebt Securities\\nThe Company’s accounting for its debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company’s intended holding period for the security, and\\nthe nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and U.S. treasury bills. Investments\\nin debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.\\nThe Company considers an available-for-sale debt security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis. The\\nentire  difference  between  the  amortized  cost  basis  and  the  fair  value  of  the  Company’s  available-for-sale  debt  securities  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated\\nstatements of operations as an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than\\nnot required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is\\ndue to credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than amortized cost,\\nchanges  to  the  rating  of  the  security  by  third-party  rating  agencies,  and  adverse  conditions  specific  to  the  security,  among  other  factors.  If  the  Company\\'s\\nassessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the credit loss is measured based on the Company\\'s best estimate of the cash flows expected to be collected. When\\ndeveloping its estimate  of cash flows expected to be collected, the Company considers all available  information relevant  to the collectability  of the security,\\nincluding past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\\nCredit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance\\nsheet with an offsetting credit loss expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an\\nadjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of December 31,\\n2020,  the  Company  had  not  recorded  any  credit  impairments.  The  Company  determines  realized  gains  or  losses  on  the  sale  of  debt  securities  on  a  specific\\nidentification method.\\nThe Company\\'s investments in debt securities include:\\n(i)\\nCash  and  cash  equivalents. Cash  equivalents  include  certificates  of  deposits,  commercial  paper  and  corporate  bonds  that  have  an\\noriginal maturity of 90 days or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\\n(ii)\\nShort-term investments. Short-term investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which\\nmature in twelve months or less. As a result, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated\\nbalance sheets.\\n(iii)\\nRestricted investments. Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit,\\nU.S. treasury bills, and corporate bonds, which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with\\ninsurance providers.\\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\\nThe  Company  has  elected  to  measure  its  investments  in  non-marketable  equity  securities  at  cost,  with  remeasurements  to  fair  value  only  upon  the\\noccurrence of observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators\\nof impairment exist. Factors considered in this assessment include the investees’ financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, exposure to industries\\nand markets impacted by COVID-19, and the time since the last adjustment to fair value, among others. If an impairment exists, the Company estimates the fair\\nvalue of the investment by using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for\\nthe amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment in the consolidated statements of operations.\\n94\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits\\nits cash with multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits\\nof cash and cash equivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits\\npurchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities.\\nFair Value Measurements\\nThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale\\nof an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market\\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair\\nvalue on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical\\nlevels of inputs to measure fair value:\\nLevel 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\\nLevel 2 Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\\ninputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable\\nmarket data by correlation or other means.\\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to\\nbe consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\\nThe carrying values of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period\\nof time to payment.\\nLight Vehicle Fleet\\nThe Company’s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters. Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid\\nexpenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the\\nscooters, which is less than 12 months. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was $8.9 million and $9.7 million,\\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was not material. Depreciation expense related to scooters was\\n$7.2 million, $35.3 million, and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Bikes are included in property and equipment,\\nnet in the consolidated balance sheets.\\nLeases\\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach with an effective date as of the beginning of the fiscal year, January 1, 2019.\\nThe Company elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward the historical\\nassessments of (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines\\nif an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right\\nto control such asset. The Company determines the classification and measurement of its leases upon lease commencement. The Company enters into certain\\nagreements as a lessor and either leases or subleases the underlying asset in the agreement to customers. The Company also enters into certain agreements as a\\nlessee. If any of the following criteria are met, the Company classifies the lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or sales-type lease (both as\\na lessor):\\n•\\nThe lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;\\n•\\nThe lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;\\n•\\nThe lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of the\\neconomic life of the underlying asset;\\n•\\nThe present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or\\n•\\nThe underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.\\nLeases that do not meet any of the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases.\\n95\\nLessor\\nThe Company\\'s lease arrangements include vehicle rentals to drivers or renters under the Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals programs and Light Vehicle rentals\\nto single-use riders. Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate\\nlease and non-lease components, such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily\\nfixed and are recognized as revenue in the period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both\\nimposed on and concurrent with each lease revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its\\nlease arrangements. The Company mitigates residual value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through\\nperiodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on the Company\\'s ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions.\\nLessee\\nThe Company\\'s leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing\\nservices on the Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related\\nright-of-use asset and lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease\\nwhen it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real\\nestate property leases, but has elected to do so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also\\napplies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.\\nThe Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount\\nthe lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest\\nthat the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic\\nenvironment.\\nLease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Company’s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are\\nincluded in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities — current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease costs\\nfor the Company\\'s operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are included in\\nproperty and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized on a\\nstraight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. The\\ninterest component of finance leases is included in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method\\nover the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognized primarily in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful\\nlife of the related asset, which is generally between two and seven years. Depreciation for property and equipment commences once they are ready for our intended\\nuse. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed\\nof, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement\\nof operations in the period realized. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease, or the useful life of the\\nassets. Construction in progress is related to property and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use.\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill represents  the  excess of the purchase  price  over the fair  value  of the net tangible  and identifiable  intangible  assets acquired  in a business\\ncombination.  Intangible  assets  resulting  from  the  acquisition  of  entities  are  accounted  for  using  the  purchase  method  of  accounting  based  on  management’s\\nestimate of the fair value of assets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve\\nyears.\\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first\\nperforms a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-\\nnot  that  the  fair  value  of  the  Company’s  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  quantitative  impairment  test  will  be  required.  Alternatively,  the\\nCompany may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\\n96\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business\\ncircumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  the  assets  may  not  be  fully  recoverable.  Such  events  and  changes  may  include:  significant  changes  in\\nperformance relative to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business strategy.\\nThe Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group\\nare expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value\\nof the asset exceeds its fair value. There was no impairment of long-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nThe Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems. The Company capitalizes development costs related to the\\nLyft Platform and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will\\nbe used to perform the function intended. The Company capitalized $12.8 million of software development costs during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the\\nyears ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, capitalized software development costs were not material.\\nInsurance Reserves\\nThe  Company  utilizes  both  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  and  third-party  insurance,  which  may  include  deductibles  and  self-insured\\nretentions, to insure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including\\npersonal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated ultimate cost for claims\\nincurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these\\noutstanding  claim  payments.  Liabilities  are  determined  on  a  quarterly  basis  by  internal  actuaries  through  an  analysis  of  historical  trends,  changes  in  claims\\nexperience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an\\nindependent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.\\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and the Company has limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history,\\nthe Company makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate\\nthe reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends\\nand the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous\\nactuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while the Company\\nbelieves that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts\\nthat will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated\\nbalance sheets. The Company continues to review our insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional claims\\nare reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.\\nNet Loss Per Share\\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating\\nsecurities.  The  two-class  method  determines  net  loss  per  common  share  for  each  class  of  common  stock  and  participating  securities  according  to  dividends\\ndeclared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period\\nto be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been\\ndistributed.  The  Company’s  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  contractually  entitles  the  holders  of  such  shares  to  participate  in  dividends  but  does  not\\ncontractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the Company’s losses.\\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period,\\nless shares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For\\nperiods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common\\nshare attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—\\nCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, which requires\\n97\\nthe measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. This standard replaces the existing incurred loss impairment\\nmodel with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-\\nthan-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than\\nas a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. Effective on January 1, 2020, the Company adopted this standard using the modified retrospective\\ntransition method. The adoption had no impact on the accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2020.\\nIn  August  2018,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2018-15,  “Intangibles—Goodwill  and  Other—Internal-Use  Software  (Subtopic  350-40):  Customer’s\\nAccounting  for  Implementation  Costs  Incurred  in  a  Cloud  Computing  Arrangement  That  Is  a  Service  Contract.”  This  standard  aligns  the  requirements  for\\ncapitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain\\ninternal-use software. The implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract should be presented as a prepaid asset on the balance\\nsheet and expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement to the same line item in the statements of operations as the costs related to the hosting fees. Effective\\non January 1, 2020, the Company adopted this standard using the prospective transition method, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial\\nstatements.\\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820).” This standard modifies disclosure requirements related to\\nfair value measurement by removing certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifying existing disclosure requirements related to\\nmeasurement uncertainty and adding new disclosure requirements, such as disclosing the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other\\ncomprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and disclosing the range and weighted average of\\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 measurements. Effective on January 1, 2020, the Company adopted this standard, which did not have a\\nmaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements.\\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\\nFinancial Reporting.” In January 2021, the FASB further issued ASU 2021-01, which clarifies the scope of the optional relief for reference rate reform provided by\\nASC Topic 848. These standards provide optional accounting relief to entities with contracts, hedge accounting relationships or other transactions that reference\\nLondon  Interbank  Offered  Rate  (\"LIBOR\")  or  other  interest  rate  benchmarks  for  which  the  referenced  rate  is  expected  to  be  discontinued  or  replaced.  The\\nCompany has agreements that have LIBOR as a reference rate with certain lenders. This optional relief generally allows for contract modifications solely related to\\nthe replacement of the reference rate to be accounted for as a continuation of the existing contract instead of as an extinguishment of the contract, and would\\ntherefore  not trigger  certain  accounting  impacts  that  would otherwise  be  required.  The  optional  relief  can  be  applied  beginning  January  1,  2020, and  ending\\nDecember 31, 2022. Effective on January 1, 2020, the Company adopted this standard and plans to apply the amendments in this update to account for contract\\nmodifications due to changes in reference rates, if applicable. As of December 31, 2020, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the\\nconsolidated financial statements and disclosures.\\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\", which is intended to\\nsimplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and by updating accounting requirements around franchise taxes, goodwill recognized for\\ntax purposes, the allocation of current and deferred tax expense among legal entities, among other minor changes. This new standard will be effective for the\\nCompany for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will\\nadopt this standard effective January 1, 2021.\\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, \"Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic\\n323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815\", which clarifies the interaction of the\\naccounting for equity securities under Topic 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting under Topic 323, and the accounting for\\ncertain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under Topic 815. This new standard will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning\\nafter December 15, 2020, including interim  periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently  assessing the impact of\\nadopting this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—\\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”, which simplifies the\\naccounting  for  convertible  instruments  by  eliminating  the  requirement  to  separate  embedded  conversion  features  from  the  host  contract  when  the  conversion\\nfeatures are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for\\nas paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for\\nembedded conversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and\\nsimplifies the diluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be\\nincluded in diluted earnings per share calculations. This new\\n98\\nstandard will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption\\nis permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the\\nconsolidated financial statements. \\nIn  October  2020,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2020-10,  “Codification  Improvements”,  which  updates  various  Codification  Topics  by  clarifying  or\\nimproving disclosure requirements to align with the SEC’s regulations, and improving the consistency of the Codification to ensure all guidance that requires or\\nprovides an option for an entity to provide information in the notes to financial statements is codified in the Disclosure Section of the Codification. This new\\nstandard will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing\\nthe impact of adopting this standard on the consolidated financial statements. \\n3. Acquisitions\\nAcquisition of Flexdrive Services, LLC (“Flexdrive”)\\nOn  February  7,  2020  (the  “Closing  Date”),  the  Company  completed  its  acquisition  of  Flexdrive  for  approximately  $20.0  million  and  treated  the\\nacquisition as a business combination. The acquisition is expected to contribute to the growth of the Company\\'s current business, and help expand the range of the\\nCompany\\'s use cases. Prior to the acquisition, the Company acted as the lessee of Flexdrive’s vehicles and sublessor for each vehicle prior to its rental by drivers.\\nAs of the Closing Date, the Company had approximately $133.1 million of operating lease right-of-use assets and $130.1 million of operating lease liabilities on\\nthe balance sheet related to this preexisting contractual relationship with Flexdrive. This preexisting contractual relationship and others were settled on the Closing\\nDate as an adjustment to the purchase price, resulting in a total acquisition consideration paid of $13.0 million.\\nAcquisition costs were immaterial and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Closing Date (in thousands):\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n587 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n276 \\nProperty and equipment\\n111,881 \\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\n56,014 \\nIdentifiable intangible assets - developed technology\\n13,200 \\nTotal identifiable assets acquired\\n181,958 \\nLoans\\n134,121 \\nFinance lease & other liabilities\\n57,265 \\nTotal liabilities assumed\\n191,386 \\nNet liabilities assumed\\n(9,428)\\nGoodwill\\n22,455 \\nTotal acquisition consideration\\n$\\n13,027 \\nGoodwill represents the excess of the total purchase consideration over the fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill\\nis attributable to expected synergies and monetization opportunities from gaining control over the Flexdrive platform (“developed technology” intangible asset)\\nand gaining greater flexibility in monetizing the fleet of owned and leased vehicles from the combined operations of the Company and Flexdrive. The acquisition is\\na taxable business combination for tax purposes and goodwill recognized in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.\\nThe fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $13.2 million with an estimated useful life of three years. The fair value\\nof the developed technology was determined using the avoided cost approach. In the avoided cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the future after-\\ntax costs which are avoided (or reduced) as a result of owning (or having the rights to) the asset for three years after the Closing Date. Indications of value were\\ndeveloped by discounting these benefits to their present value.\\nThe results of operations for the acquired business have been included in the consolidated statements of operations for the period subsequent to the\\nCompany\\'s  acquisition  of  Flexdrive.  Flexdrive\\'s  results  of  operations  for  periods  prior  to  this  acquisition  were  not  material  to  the  consolidated  statements  of\\noperations and, accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented.\\n99\\nAcquisition of Bikeshare Holdings LLC (“Motivate”)\\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Motivate, a New York-headquartered bikeshare company, for cash consideration of\\n$250.9 million. The purpose of the acquisition is to establish a solid foothold in the bikeshare market and offer access to new transportation options on the Lyft\\nPlatform.\\nAcquisition costs of $2.6 million were expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of\\noperations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\\nIn connection with the acquisition of Motivate, the Company recognized identifiable assets and assumed liabilities based on their respective fair values at\\nNovember 30, 2018. The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n7,248 \\nPrepaid expenses and other assets\\n20,458 \\nProperty and equipment\\n68,312 \\nIdentifiable intangible assets\\n89,800 \\nTotal identifiable assets acquired\\n185,818 \\nTotal liabilities assumed\\n53,357 \\nNet assets acquired\\n132,461 \\nGoodwill\\n118,474 \\nTotal acquisition consideration\\n$\\n250,935 \\nGoodwill represents the excess of the total purchase consideration over the fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill\\nis attributable to expected synergies and monetization opportunities from the expanded platform as well as planned growth in new markets expected to be achieved\\nfrom the combined operations of the Company and Motivate. The acquisition is considered to be an asset acquisition for tax purposes and goodwill recognized in\\nthe acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded immaterial measurement period adjustments. The offset\\nof these adjustments were recorded as a decrease to goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet.\\nAn assessment of the fair value of identified intangible assets and their respective useful lives as of the acquisition date are as follows:\\nFair Value \\n(in thousands)\\nEstimated Useful \\nLife (In years)\\nContractual relationships – cities\\n$\\n61,100 \\n4-12\\nUser relationships\\n18,700 \\n3\\nDeveloped technology\\n10,000 \\n1\\nTotal intangible assets\\n$\\n89,800 \\nThe fair value of the contractual relationships – cities was determined using the income approach. In the income approach, the fair value of an asset is\\nbased on the expected receipt of future economic benefits such as earnings and cash inflows from current sales projections and estimated costs over the estimated\\ncontractual relationship period which varies from four to twelve years. Indications of value were developed by discounting these benefits to their present value.\\nThe fair value of the user relationships and developed technology was determined using the replacement cost approach. In the replacement cost approach,\\nthe fair value of an asset is based on the cost of a market participant to reconstruct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for any obsolescence. The fair\\nvalue of the asset would include the seller’s expected profit margin in the market and any opportunity costs lost over the period to reconstruct the substitute asset.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, Motivate revenue and net loss included in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations were not material.\\nOver the approximately five years following the transaction, the Company committed to invest an aggregate of $100 million in the bikeshare program for\\nthe New York metro area. The Company also assumed certain pre-existing contractual obligations to increase the bike fleets in other locations, which are not\\nconsidered to be material.\\nOther Acquisitions\\nIn  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  the  Company  completed  two  additional  business  combinations  in  exchange  for  cash  of  $35.0  million,  redeemable\\nconvertible preferred stock of $25.3 million and a liability of $1.7 million related to indemnification aggregating\\n100\\nto a total consideration of approximately $62.0 million which are not material to the consolidated financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company\\ncompleted two business combinations which are not material to the consolidated financial statements.\\nPro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the acquisitions were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial\\nstatements.\\n4.

The term deposits are at cost, which approximates\\nfair value.\\nThe weighted-average  remaining  maturity  of  the  Company’s  investment  portfolio  was less  than  one  year  as  of  the  periods  presented.  No individual\\nsecurity incurred continuous unrealized losses for greater than 12 months.\\nThe  Company  purchases  investment  grade  marketable  debt  securities  which  are  rated  by  nationally  recognized  statistical  rating  organizations  in\\naccordance with its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize the Company\\'s exposure to credit losses. As of December 31, 2020, the credit-quality of\\nthe Company’s marketable available-for-sale debt securities had remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities\\nas of December 31, 2020 was primarily related to the extreme market volatility associated with COVID-19. The contractual terms of these investments do not\\npermit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments and it is not expected that the investments would be settled at\\na price less than their amortized cost basis. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be\\nrequired to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require\\nthe Company to change its assessment of credit losses for any marketable available-for-sale debt security as of December 31, 2020. These estimates may change,\\nas new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. No\\ncredit losses were recognized as of December 31, 2020 for the Company’s marketable and non-marketable debt securities.\\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position for which no allowance for credit losses\\nwas recorded, aggregated by major security type (in thousands):\\nDecember 31, 2020\\nEstimated Fair Value\\nUnrealized Losses\\nCertificates of deposit\\n$\\n167,793 \\n$\\n(7)\\nCorporate bonds\\n179,369 \\n(67)\\nCommercial paper\\n164,595 \\n(30)\\nTotal available-for-sale debt in an unrealized loss position\\n$\\n511,757 \\n$\\n(104)\\nProperty and Equipment, net\\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\\nDecember 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nBike fleet\\n$\\n140,473 \\n$\\n124,380 \\n$\\n65,985 \\nLeasehold improvements\\n105,169 \\n66,490 \\n39,727 \\nOwned vehicles\\n112,498 \\n— \\n— \\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\n28,109 \\n— \\n— \\nComputer equipment and software\\n17,923 \\n14,026 \\n11,366 \\nFurniture and fixtures\\n5,099 \\n473 \\n262 \\nConstruction in progress\\n19,957 \\n25,139 \\n3,629 \\n429,228 \\n230,508 \\n120,969 \\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\\n(115,931)\\n(41,905)\\n(11,712)\\nProperty and equipment, net\\n$\\n313,297 \\n$\\n188,603 \\n$\\n109,257 \\nDepreciation  and  amortization  expense  related  to  property  and  equipment  was  $121.0  million,  $37.9  million,  and  $8.6  million  for  the  years  ended\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\n103\\nAccrued and Other Current Liabilities\\nAccrued and other current liabilities consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\\nDecember 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\nRide-related accruals\\n$\\n196,439 \\n$\\n253,840 \\nInsurance-related accruals\\n269,849 \\n218,161 \\nLegal accruals\\n226,408 \\n162,766 \\nInsurance claims payable and related fees\\n28,318 \\n87,357 \\nLong-term debt, current\\n35,760 \\n— \\nOther\\n197,234 \\n217,741 \\nAccrued and other current liabilities\\n$\\n954,008 \\n$\\n939,865 \\nInsurance Reserves\\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the insurance reserve for the periods presented (in thousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nBeginning balance\\n$\\n1,378,462 \\n$\\n810,273 \\n$\\n376,538 \\nLosses paid\\n(552,693)\\n(540,627)\\n(220,936)\\nChange in estimates for prior periods\\n168,131 \\n219,163 \\n3,392 \\nTransfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities\\n(407,885)\\n— \\n— \\nReserves for current period\\n401,049 \\n889,653 \\n651,279 \\nEnding balance\\n$\\n987,064 \\n$\\n1,378,462 \\n$\\n810,273 \\nOn  March  31,  2020,  the  Company’s  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  PVIC,  entered  into  a  Novation  Agreement  with  Clarendon,  and  certain  underwriting\\ncompanies of Zurich.

The fair value of the Company’s\\nLevel 2 fixed income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or\\nmodel  driven  valuations  using  observable  market  data  or  inputs  corroborated  by  observable  market  data.  Level  3  instrument  valuations  are  valued  based  on\\nunobservable  inputs  and  other  estimation  techniques  due  to  the  absence  of  quoted  market  prices,  inherent  lack  of  liquidity  and  the  long-term  nature  of  such\\nfinancial instruments.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n105\\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\\nIn  March  2020,  the  Company  purchased  a  non-marketable  equity  security  for  total  cash  consideration  of  $10.0  million  that  is  classified  in  other\\ninvestments on the consolidated balance sheets. The non-marketable equity security will be remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence of observable transactions\\nfor an identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. As of December 31, 2020, there were no remeasurement adjustments.\\n7. Leases\\nReal Estate Operating Leases\\nThe Company leases real estate property at approximately 86 locations with 85 commenced leases and one not yet commenced lease having an initial\\nterm of 12 months or longer as of December 31, 2020. These leases are classified as operating leases. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining lease terms vary\\nfrom one month to nine years. For certain leases the Company has options to extend the lease term for periods varying from one to ten years. These renewal\\noptions are not considered in the remaining lease term unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of\\n12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representing the fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments\\nrelated to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance or other services provided by the landlord, are accounted for as a component of the lease\\npayment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.\\nFlexdrive Program\\nThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing companies. These leases\\nare classified as finance leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining lease\\nterms  vary  between  one  month  to  four  years.  These  leases  generally  do  not  contain  any  non-lease  components  and,  as  such,  all  payments  due  under  these\\narrangements are allocated to the respective lease component.\\n106\\nLease Position as of December 31, 2020\\nThe table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands, except for remaining lease terms\\nand percentages):\\nDecember 31, 2020\\nDecember 31, 2019\\nOperating Leases\\nAssets\\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n275,756 \\n$\\n441,258 \\nLiabilities\\nOperating lease liabilities, current\\n$\\n49,291 \\n$\\n94,199 \\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current\\n265,803 \\n382,077 \\nTotal operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n315,094 \\n$\\n476,276 \\nFinance Leases\\nAssets\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n28,108 \\n$\\n— \\nLiabilities\\nFinance lease liabilities, current\\n20,795 \\n— \\nFinance lease liabilities, non-current\\n6,593 \\n— \\nTotal finance lease liabilities\\n$\\n27,388 \\n$\\n— \\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\\nOperating leases\\n6.3\\n5.6\\nFinance leases\\n1.5\\n— \\nWeighted-average discount rate\\nOperating leases\\n6.4 %\\n6.6 %\\nFinance leases\\n4.7 %\\n— %\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nThis balance is included within property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets and was primarily related to leases acquired in the Flexdrive transaction.

Commitments and Contingencies\\nNoncancelable Purchase Commitments\\nIn March 2018, the Company entered into a noncancelable arrangement with a web-hosting services provider under which the Company had an obligation\\nto purchase a minimum amount of services from this vendor through June 2021. In January 2019 and May 2020, the parties modified the aggregate commitment\\namounts and timing. Under the amended arrangement, the Company committed to spend an aggregate of at least $300 million between January 2019 and June\\n2022, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the three contractual periods, on services with this vendor. The Company has made payments totaling\\n$240.6 million under the amended arrangement as of December 31, 2020.\\nIn November 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Motivate, a New York headquartered bikeshare company. Over the approximately five\\nyears following the transaction, the Company committed to invest an aggregate of $100.0 million in the bikeshare program for the New York metro area. The\\nCompany also assumed certain pre-existing contractual obligations to increase the bike fleets in other locations which are not considered to be material. The\\nCompany has made investments totaling $46.9 million as of December 31, 2020.\\nIn May 2019, the Company entered into a noncancelable arrangement with the City of Chicago, with respect to the Divvy bike share program, under\\nwhich the Company has an obligation to pay approximately $7.5 million per year to the City of Chicago through January 2028 and to spend a minimum of $50\\nmillion on capital equipment for the bike share program through January 2023. The Company has made payments totaling $15.0 million and investments totaling\\n$19.7 million as of December 31, 2020.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, the future minimum payments under the Company’s noncancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in thousands):\\n2021\\n$\\n27,990 \\n2022\\n130,514 \\n2023\\n36,519 \\n2024\\n8,800 \\n2025\\n9,092 \\nThereafter\\n19,107 \\nTotal future minimum payments\\n$\\n232,022 \\nLetters of Credit\\nThe Company maintains certain stand-by letters of credit from third-party financial institutions in the ordinary course of business to guarantee certain\\nperformance obligations related to leases, insurance policies and other various contractual arrangements. The outstanding letters of credit are collateralized by cash.\\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of $54.2 million and $55.2 million, respectively.\\nIndemnification\\nThe Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain business\\npartners, investors, contractors and the Company’s officers, directors and certain employees. The Company has agreed to indemnify and defend the indemnified\\nparty’s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-party claims because of the Company’s\\nactivities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations  and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine the maximum\\npotential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances\\ninvolved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisions have\\nnot been material.\\n109\\nLegal Proceedings\\nThe  Company  is  currently  involved  in,  and  may  in  the  future  be  involved  in,  legal  proceedings,  claims,  regulatory  inquiries,  and  governmental\\ninvestigations in the ordinary course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, or third parties (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other\\nthings, various wage and expense related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company’s fees, rules or policies, that such fees,\\nrules or policies violate applicable law, or that the Company has not acted in conformity with such fees, rules or policies, as well as proceedings related to product\\nliability, its acquisitions, securities issuances or business practices, or public disclosures about the business. In addition, the Company has been, and is currently,\\nnamed as a defendant in a number of litigation matters related to accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.\\nThe outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a\\nmaterial loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor is the Company able to estimate the loss or range of\\nlosses that could potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material\\nloss in excess of the amount recorded.\\nIndependent Contractor Classification Matters\\nWith regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the\\nclassification of these drivers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws\\nthat would apply to driver employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to change and divergent\\ninterpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.\\nFor example, Assembly Bill 5 (as codified in part at Cal. Labor Code sec. 2750.3) codified and extended an employment classification test set forth by the\\nCalifornia Supreme Court that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional\\nchallenges to the independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the\\nCity Attorneys of Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’\\nrespective platforms as independent contractors in violation of Assembly Bill 5 and California’s Unfair Competition Law, and on August 5, 2020, the California\\nLabor Commissioner filed lawsuits against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective platforms as independent\\ncontractors,  seeking  injunctive  relief  and  material  damages  and  penalties.  On  June  25,  2020,  the  California  Attorney  General  and  the  City  Attorneys  of  Los\\nAngeles, San Diego, and San Francisco filed a motion for preliminary injunction against the Company and Uber. On August 10, 2020, the court granted the motion\\nfor a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers in California as employees until the end of the lawsuit. On August 12, 2020, the\\nCompany filed a notice of appeal of the court\\'s order and on August 20, 2020, the California Court of Appeal stayed the preliminary injunction pending resolution\\nof the appeal. The Court of Appeal affirmed the preliminary injunction on October 22, 2020. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state\\nballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and\\nProposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. The Company filed a petition for rehearing of its appeal with the California Court of Appeal on November\\n6, 2020, which was denied on November 20, 2020. On December 1, 2020, the Company filed a petition for review with the California Supreme Court, which was\\ndenied on February 10, 2021. The case will now proceed in San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a lawsuit was filed in the California Supreme\\nCourt against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 violates the California Constitution. The Supreme Court denied review on February 3, 2021.\\nPlaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021. Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General\\nfiled a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory and\\ninjunctive relief. Certain adverse outcomes of such actions would have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations,\\nincluding damages, penalties and potential suspension of operations in impacted jurisdictions, including California. The Company’s chances of success on the\\nmerits  are  still  uncertain  and  any  possible  loss  or  range  of  loss  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated.  Such  regulatory  scrutiny  or  action  may  create  different  or\\nconflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another.\\nThe  Company  is  currently  involved  in  a  number  of  putative  class  actions,  thousands  of  individual  claims,  including  those  brought  in  arbitration  or\\ncompelled pursuant to the Company\\'s Terms of Service to arbitration, matters brought, in whole or in part, as representative actions under California’s Private\\nAttorney General Act, Labor Code Section 2698, et seq., alleging that the Company misclassified drivers as independent contractors and other matters challenging\\nthe classification of drivers on the Company’s platform as independent contractors. The Company is currently defending allegations in a number of lawsuits that\\nthe Company has failed to properly classify drivers and provide those drivers with sick leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s\\nchances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\n110\\nThe Company disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. However, results of litigation,\\narbitration and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these driver claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a\\nmaterial impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can\\nhave an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other\\nfactors.\\nUnemployment Insurance Assessment\\nThe Company is involved in administrative audits with various state employment agencies, including audits related to driver classification, in California,\\nConnecticut,  Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois  and New Jersey. The Company believes  that drivers  are properly  classified  as independent  contractors  and plans to\\nvigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of\\nloss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nIndirect Taxes\\nThe Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily\\narises from disputes on tax treatment and tax rates applied to the sale of the Company’s services in these jurisdictions. The Company accrues indirect taxes that\\nmay result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is\\nrecorded to general and administrative expenses.\\nPatent Litigation\\nThe Company is currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary\\ncourse of business, the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property\\nand/or asserting infringement of such property. The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The\\nCompany’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nConsumer and Other Class Actions\\nThe Company is involved in a number of class actions alleging violations of consumer protection laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of\\n1991, or TCPA, as well as violations of other laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, seeking injunctive or other relief. The Company\\ndisputes any allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are\\nstill uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nPersonal Injury and Other Safety Matters\\nIn the ordinary course of the Company’s business, various parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that the Company is liable\\nfor damages related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders or renters using or who have used services offered on the Lyft Platform, as well as from\\nthird parties. The Company is currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers on the Lyft Platform,\\nother riders, renters  and third parties.  The Company believes  it has meritorious  defenses,  disputes the allegations  of  wrongdoing and intends to defend itself\\nvigorously in these matters. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company’s\\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently\\nunpredictable and legal proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations. For example, on January 17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple\\nplaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating to alleged sexual assault or harassment by drivers on the Lyft Platform, and a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding\\nhas been created before the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, where the claims of these and other plaintiffs are currently pending. Regardless\\nof the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of\\nmanagement resources and other factors.\\n111\\nSecurities Litigation\\nBeginning  in  April  2019,  multiple  putative  class  actions  and  derivative  actions  have  been  filed  in  state  and  federal  courts  against  the  Company,  its\\ndirectors, certain of its officers, and certain of the underwriters named in the IPO Registration Statement alleging violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the IPO. The putative class actions have been consolidated into two putative class actions, one in California\\nstate court and the other in federal court. The derivative actions have also been consolidated into one action in federal court in California. On July 1, 2020, the\\nCalifornia  state  court  sustained  in  part  and  overruled  in  part  the  Company’s  demurrer  to  the  consolidated  complaint.  The  Company  filed  its  answer  to  this\\nconsolidated complaint on August 3, 2020. On February 26, 2021, the California state court struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and\\ngranted plaintiffs leave to amend. The parties are litigating the plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class action. On May 14, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss\\nthe consolidated complaint in the California federal court putative class action, and on September 8, 2020, the federal court granted in part and denied in part that\\nmotion. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on October 2, 2020, and the parties are litigating the plaintiff’s motion to certify a class\\naction. A joint stipulation to stay the consolidated derivative action was filed by the parties in the California federal court. The Company believes these lawsuits are\\nwithout merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

The 2025 Notes were offered and sold\\npursuant to a purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as representatives of the\\nseveral initial purchasers (the \"Initial Purchasers\") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933,\\nas amended (the “Securities Act”).\\nThe 2025 Notes mature on May 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the\\nCompany with interest payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020, at a rate of 1.50% per year.\\nThe net proceeds from this offering were approximately $733.2 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and debt issuance costs.\\nThe conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is 26.0491 shares of the Company\\'s Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, which is\\nequivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $38.39 per share of the Class A Common Stock. The initial conversion price of the 2025 Notes represents\\na premium of approximately 30% to the $29.53 per share closing price of the Company\\'s Class A Common Stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12,\\n2020. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n112\\nThe 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding\\nFebruary 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances:\\n•\\nduring any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last\\nreported sale price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30\\nconsecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to\\n130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\\n•\\nduring the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as\\ndefined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the\\nproduct of the last reported sale price of the Company\\'s Class A Common Stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\\n•\\nif the Company calls such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately\\npreceding the redemption date; or\\n•\\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\\nOn or after February 15, 2025, the 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder until the close of business on the second scheduled trading\\nday immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may\\nbe, cash, shares of the Company\\'s Class A Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\\'s Class A Common Stock, at the Company’s\\nelection, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture.\\nHolders of the 2025 Notes who convert their 2025 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as\\ndefined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a\\nfundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2025 Notes at a repurchase price\\nequal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\\nIn accounting for the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into a liability and an equity component. At the date of issuance,\\nthe Company determined the fair value of the liability component to be $558.3 million calculated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the\\nborrowing rate for a similar nonconvertible debt instrument. The equity component representing the conversion option was $189.2 million and was determined by\\ndeducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2025 Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet\\nthe conditions for equity classification. The difference between the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and the liability component (\"debt discount\") is amortized\\nto interest expense over the contractual term at an effective interest rate of 8.0%.\\nDebt issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes totaled $14.3 million and was comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the Initial Purchasers and\\nthird-party offering costs. The Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the 2025 Notes based on their relative values.\\nIssuance costs attributable to the liability component were $10.7 million and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the\\ncontractual term. Issuance costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in stockholders’ equity.\\nBased  on  the  Company’s  closing  stock  price  on December  31,  2020,  the  if-converted  value  of  the  2025  Notes  was  $956.6  million,  exceeding  the\\noutstanding principal amount.\\nThe net carrying amounts of the liability component of the 2025 Notes were as follows (in thousands):\\nDecember 31, 2020\\nPrincipal\\n$\\n747,500 \\nUnamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs\\n(178,756)\\nNet carrying amount of liability component\\n$\\n568,744 \\nAs of December 31, 2020, the total estimated fair values (which represents a Level 2 valuation) of the 2025 Notes were approximately $1.1 billion. The\\nestimated fair value of the 2025 Notes was determined based on a market approach which was determined based on the actual bids and offers of the 2025 Notes in\\nan over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the period.\\nThe 2025 Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants, restrictions on dividends, incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or\\nrestrictions on the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company.\\n113\\nCapped Calls\\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with\\ncertain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates (the \"option counterparties\") at a cost of approximately $132.7 million. The Capped Calls cover,\\nsubject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the 2025 Notes sold in the offering. By entering into the Capped\\nCalls, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2025 Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its\\ncash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2025 Notes its common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2025 Notes. The\\ncap price of the Capped Calls will initially be $73.83 per share, which represents a premium of 150% over the last reported sale price of the Company\\'s Class A\\nCommon Stock of $29.53 per share on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2020, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped\\nCalls.\\nThe Capped Calls meet the criteria for classification in equity, are not remeasured each reporting period and included as a reduction to additional paid-in-\\ncapital within shareholders’ equity.\\nNon-revolving Loan\\nFollowing the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Loan and Security\\nAgreement dated March 11, 2019, as amended (the “Non-revolving Loan”) with a third-party lender. Pursuant to the term of the Non-revolving Loan, Flexdrive\\nmay request an extension of credit in the form of advances up to a maximum principal amount of $300 million to purchase new Hyundai and Kia vehicles, or for\\nother purposes, subject to approval by the lender. Advances paid or prepaid under the Non-revolving Loan may not be reborrowed. Repayment terms for each\\nadvance include equal monthly installments sufficient to fully amortize the advances over the term, with an option for the final installment to be greater than the\\nothers. The repayment term for each advance ranges from 24 months to a maximum term of 48 months. Interest is payable monthly in arrears at a fixed interest rate\\nequal to the one-month LIBOR plus a spread on the date of the loan which ranges from 2.68% for an advance with a 24 month term and 2.88% for an advance with\\na 48 month term. The Non-revolving Loan is secured by all vehicles financed under the Non-revolving Loan.\\nThe Non-revolving Loan also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit Flexdrive’s ability to enter into\\ncertain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency\\nevents  with  respect  to  Flexdrive  or  the  Company,  all  amounts  due  under  the  Non-revolving  Loan  may  become  immediately  due  and  payable,  among  other\\nremedies. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Non-revolving Loan. Further, the Company continued to\\nguarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed following the acquisition.\\nMaster Vehicle Loan\\nFollowing the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Master Vehicle\\nAcquisition Financing and Security Agreement, dated February 7, 2020 as amended (the “Master Vehicle Loan”) with a third-party lender. Pursuant to the term of\\nthe Master Vehicle Loan, Flexdrive may request loans up to a maximum principal amount of $50 million to purchase vehicles. Repayment terms for each loan\\ninclude equal monthly installments sufficient to amortize  the loan over the term, with an option for the final installment to be greater than the others and is\\ntypically equal to the residual value guarantee the Company provides to the lender. The repayment term for each loan ranges from a minimum term of 12 months to\\na maximum term of 48 months. Interest is payable monthly in advance at a fixed interest rate equal to the three-year swap rate plus a spread of 2.10% on the date\\nof the loan. Principal amounts outstanding related to the Master Vehicle Loan may be fully or partially prepaid at the option of Flexdrive and must be prepaid\\nunder certain circumstances. However, if a loan is terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the minimum loan term Flexdrive will be obligated to pay to\\nthe lender, an early termination fee in an amount which is equal to the interest which would otherwise be payable by Flexdrive to lender for the remainder of the\\nminimum loan term for that loan. The Master Vehicle Loan is secured by all vehicles financed under the Master Vehicle Loan as well as certain amounts held in\\nescrow for the benefit of the lender. Amounts held in escrow are recorded as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet.\\nThe Master Vehicle Loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain\\nacquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events\\nwith respect to Flexdrive or the Company, all amounts due under the Master Vehicle Loan may become immediately due and payable, among other remedies. As\\nof December 31, 2020, Flexdrive was in compliance with all covenants related to the Master Vehicle Loan in all material respects. Further, the Company continued\\nto guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed following the acquisition.\\nThe fair values of the Non-revolving Loan and Master Vehicle Loan were $105.3 million and $8.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and\\nwere determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\\n114\\nMaturities of long-term debt outstanding, including current maturities, as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\\n2021\\n$\\n35,789 \\n2022\\n54,309 \\n2023\\n21,066 \\n2024\\n88 \\n2025\\n568,744 \\nThereafter\\n— \\nTotal long-term debt outstanding\\n$\\n679,996 \\nVehicle Procurement Agreement\\nFollowing  the  acquisition  of  Flexdrive  by  the  Company  on  February  7,  2020,  Flexdrive  remained  responsible  for  its  obligations  under  a  Vehicle\\nProcurement Agreement (“VPA”), as amended, with a third-party (“the Procurement Provider”). Procurement services under the VPA include purchasing and\\nupfitting certain motor vehicles as specified by Flexdrive, providing certain fleet management services, including without limitation vehicle titling, registration and\\ntracking services on behalf of Flexdrive. Pursuant to the terms of the VPA, Flexdrive will make the applicable payments to the Procurement Provider for the\\nprocurement services either directly or through an advance made by the Master Vehicle Loan or the Non-revolving Loan. Interest is payable on any unpaid amount\\nbased on either the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least seven of the ten largest US banks or LIBOR of interest for one month periods as set forth in The\\nWall Street Journal plus a spread of 3.00%, as applicable.\\nThe Procurement Provider has a security interest in vehicles purchased until the full specified payment has been indefeasibly paid. The VPA contains\\ncustomary affirmative  and negative covenants restricting  certain activities by Flexdrive. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance  with all\\ncovenants of the VPA.\\nOn March 11, 2019, the Procurement Provider entered into a $95.0 million revolving credit facility with a third-party lender to finance the acquisition of\\nmotor vehicles on behalf of Flexdrive under the VPA. On September 17, 2020, the revolving credit facility was amended, extending the stated maturity date to\\nDecember 31, 2021 and reducing the borrowing capacity to $50.0 million. On March 11, 2019, Flexdrive entered into a Limited Non-Recourse Secured Continuing\\nGuaranty and Subordination Agreement with the third-party lender to guarantee the Procurement Provider\\'s performance for any amount borrowed under the\\nrevolving credit facility. Flexdrive\\'s maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee is $8.6 million as of December 31, 2020, which represents 100%\\nof the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\\n10.

The aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the original exercise price of the stock\\noption and the fair value of the Company’s common stock of $49.13, $43.02 and $47.37 per share as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nIn  the  first  quarter  of  2019,  the  Company  issued  3,162,797  shares  of  its  common  stock,  valued  at  $205.6  million,  pursuant  to  the  exercise  by  the\\nCompany’s co-founders of all their respective vested and outstanding options (after withholding an aggregate of 3,617,460 shares of common stock subject to such\\noptions for payment of the exercise price and satisfaction of the aggregate tax withholding obligations, totaling $223.5 million, in connection with the exercise of\\ncertain of those options). In the second quarter of 2019, these shares of common stock were reclassified into shares of Class A common stock and subsequently\\nexchanged for shares of Class B common stock as described in Note 1 - Description of Business and Basis of Presentation - Initial Public Offering.\\n118\\nThe summary of restricted stock unit activity is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\\nNumber of \\nShares\\nWeighted- \\nAverage \\nGrant Date \\nFair Value\\nAggregate \\nIntrinsic \\nValue\\nNonvested units as of December 31, 2019\\n41,685 \\n$\\n52.06 \\n$\\n1,793,305 \\nGranted\\n25,130 \\n28.76 \\nVested\\n(19,762)\\n43.72 \\nCanceled\\n(13,451)\\n47.03 \\nNonvested units as of December 31, 2020\\n33,602 \\n$\\n41.49 \\n$\\n1,650,577 \\nExpected to vest as of December 31, 2020\\n32,047 \\n$\\n1,323,220 \\nIncluded in the grants for the year ended December 31, 2020 are approximately 250,000 PSUs that have a performance criteria tied to the Company’s\\nAdjusted EBITDA profitability target. The grant date fair value per share of the PSUs granted in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $27.14. Compensation\\ncost associated with these PSUs are recognized based on the estimated number of shares that the Company ultimately expects will vest and amortized on a straight-\\nline basis over the requisite service period as these PSUs consist of only one tranche. If in the future, situations indicate that it is not probable that we will achieve\\nthe performance criteria, then no further compensation cost will be recorded and any previous costs will be reversed.\\nThe fair value as of the respective  vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $700.9 million and\\n$1.8 billion, respectively. No RSUs vested during the year ended December 31, 2018. In connection with RSUs that vested in the year ended December 31, 2020,\\nthe  Company  withheld  551,372  shares  and  remitted  tax  liabilities  of  $20.2  million  on  behalf  of  the  RSU  holders  to  the  relevant  tax  authorities  in  cash.  In\\nconnection with RSUs that vested in the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company withheld 10,777,331 shares and remitted tax liabilities of $719.5 million on\\nbehalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities in cash.\\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company changed the default tax withholding method for RSUs from the net settlement method to the sell-to-\\ncover method. As a result, no shares were withheld to settle tax withholding obligations for RSUs that vested and settled in the fourth quarter of 2019. The tax\\nwithholding obligations for RSUs held by Section 16 officers of the Company that vest and settle after December 31, 2019 will revert to the net settlement method.\\n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\\nIn March 2019, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the\\n“ESPP”). The ESPP went into effect on March 27, 2019. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute, through\\npayroll  deductions,  up  to  15%  of  their  eligible  compensation  to  purchase  the  Company’s  Class  A  common  stock  at  a  discounted  price  per  share.  The  ESPP\\nprovides for consecutive, overlapping 12-month offering periods, subject to certain reset provisions as defined in the plan. The initial offering period ran from\\nMarch 28, 2019 through June 30, 2020.\\nA  total  of  6,000,000   shares  of  Class  A  common  stock  were  initially  reserved  for  issuance  under  the  ESPP  and  on  January  1,  2020,  an  additional\\n3,025,957 shares of Class A common stock were reserved for issuance under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2020, 1,296,206 shares of Class A common stock have\\nbeen purchased under the 2019 ESPP. The number of shares reserved under the 2019 ESPP will automatically increase on the first day of each calendar year\\nbeginning on January 1, 2020 in a number of shares equal to the least of (i) 7,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, (ii) one percent of the outstanding shares of\\nall classes of the Company’s common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the 2019\\nESPP.\\n119\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThe  Company  recorded  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  periods  indicated  as  follows  (in\\nthousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n28,743 \\n$\\n81,321 \\n$\\n501 \\nOperations and support\\n15,829 \\n75,212 \\n177 \\nResearch and development\\n325,624 \\n971,941 \\n4,107 \\nSales and marketing\\n23,385 \\n72,046 \\n261 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n172,226 \\n398,791 \\n3,531 \\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\\n$\\n565,807 \\n$\\n1,599,311 \\n$\\n8,577 \\nIn conjunction with one of the acquisitions in 2018, the Company issued 241,390 shares of restricted stock awards to executives of an acquired company\\nwith an aggregate grant-date fair value of $11.4 million. These restricted stock awards are fully vested as of the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company\\nrecorded $4.2 million, $6.0 million and $1.4 million as compensation related to these vested restricted stock awards which is included in research and development\\nexpense in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\\nAs of December 31, 2020 there are no remaining unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options and restricted stock awards. As of\\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018, there was $3.9 million and $9.6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and restricted stock\\nawards, which was recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.7 years and 1.6 years, respectively.\\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  the  total  unrecognized  compensation  cost  was  $905.6  million.  The  Company  expects  to  recognize  this  expense  over  the\\nremaining weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years. The Company recognizes compensation expense on the RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of\\nits IPO Registration Statement on March 28, 2019 using the accelerated attribution method. All RSUs granted after March 28, 2019 vest on the satisfaction of a\\nservice-based condition only. The Company recognizes compensation expense for such RSUs upon a straight-line basis over their requisite service periods.\\n12. Tender Offer\\nIn March 2018, the Company facilitated a tender offer whereby an existing stockholder and affiliated entities (the Purchaser) would purchase up to an\\naggregate  of  2,207,792  shares  of  common  stock  for  $38.50  per  share  in  cash  from  certain  equity  holders  (including  then-current  employees).  The  Company\\nengaged a third-party broker to facilitate an auction process whereby the Purchaser was selected. At the time of the tender offer, the fair value of the Company’s\\ncommon stock was equal to the tender offer price. Sellers holding options were permitted to cashless exercise options in connection with their participation in the\\ntender offer. The tender offer closed in April 2018 and an aggregate of 1,523,532 shares of common stock were tendered for $58.7 million.\\n13.

The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the\\nrealizability of the deferred tax assets such that a valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include the Company’s history of net losses since its\\ninception.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $6.2 billion, $5.4 billion\\nand $3.4 million, respectively.\\nThe federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates beginning in 2030 and will continue to expire\\nthrough 2037, while federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 or later do not expire. The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in\\n2022  and  will  continue  to  expire  through  2039.  The  foreign  net  operating  loss  carryovers  will  begin  to  expire  in  2037.  Utilization  of  the  net  operating  loss\\ncarryforwards are subject to various limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state\\nprovisions.\\nThe Company files income tax returns with the U.S. federal government, various state jurisdictions and certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax\\nreturns in all jurisdictions remain open to examination.\\nThe Company began having foreign operations in fiscal year 2017. At that time and prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company had indefinite\\ninvestment assertion on all of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company has reevaluated its\\nhistoric assertion and continues to assert these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested.\\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued\\ninterest and penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and\\npenalties  in  its  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  nor  has  it  accrued  for  or  made  payments  for  interest  and  penalties.  The  Company  has  no  material\\nunrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\\n14. Net Loss Per Share\\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period,\\nless shares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for\\nthe period. For purposes of this calculation, redeemable convertible preferred stock, stock options, RSUs, PSUs, the 2025 Notes, restricted stock awards, stock\\npurchase rights granted under the Company’s ESPP, and early exercised stock options are considered to be common stock equivalents but are excluded from the\\ncalculation of diluted net loss per share when including them has an anti-dilutive effect. Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same for each class of common\\nstock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.\\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nNet loss\\n$\\n(1,752,857)\\n$\\n(2,602,241)\\n$\\n(911,335)\\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share, basic and diluted\\n312,175 \\n227,498 \\n21,176 \\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted\\n$\\n(5.61)\\n$\\n(11.44)\\n$\\n(43.04)\\n122\\nThe following potentially dilutive outstanding shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because\\nincluding them would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied\\nby the end of the period (in thousands):\\nAs of December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nRestricted stock units\\n33,428 \\n41,685 \\n46,433 \\n2025 Notes\\n19,471 \\n— \\n— \\nStock options\\n1,919 \\n2,957 \\n13,818 \\nPerformance based restricted stock units\\n175 \\n— \\n— \\nESPP\\n89 \\n— \\n— \\nRestricted stock awards\\n— \\n94 \\n220 \\nRedeemable convertible preferred stock (on an if-converted basis)\\n— \\n— \\n219,176 \\nEarly exercised options\\n— \\n— \\n— \\nTotal\\n55,082 \\n44,736 \\n279,647 \\n_______________\\n(1)\\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into Capped Calls, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares\\noutstanding,  as  their  effect  would  have  been  anti-dilutive.  The  Capped  Calls  are  expected  to  reduce  the  potential  dilution  to  the  Company\\'s  common  stock  (or,  in  the  event  a\\nconversion of the 2025 Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2025 Notes the Company\\'s common stock price\\nexceeds the conversion price of the 2025 Notes.\\n15. Related-Party Transactions\\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company purchased certain advertising-related and other services in the amount of\\n$18.1 million and $92.4 million, respectively, from a company that is affiliated with a significant stockholder of the Company, which was recorded to cost of\\nrevenue and sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the services. This entity ceased to be a related party\\nin April 2019.\\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company purchased certain marketing services in the amount of $1.9 million and\\n$4.0 million, respectively, from two companies owned by a significant stockholder of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the amounts\\npurchased from these related parties as included in the consolidated statement of operations were immaterial.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, amounts due from and to these related parties as included in the consolidated balance sheets were immaterial.\\nThe Company\\'s remaining transactions with related parties were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\\n16. 401(k) Plan\\nThe Company adopted a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the IRC. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating\\nemployees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company does not make contributions for eligible\\nemployees.\\n17. Restructuring\\nApril 2020 Restructuring Plan\\nIn  April  2020,  the  Company  announced  a  restructuring  plan  to  reduce  operating  expenses  and  adjust  cash  flows  in  light  of  the  ongoing  economic\\nchallenges  resulting  from the COVID-19 pandemic  and its impact  on the Company’s business. As a result  of the restructuring  plan, which was substantially\\ncompleted in the second quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a stock-based compensation benefit related to the reversal of previously recognized stock-based\\ncompensation expenses for unvested stock awards, primarily related to RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of its IPO Registration Statement on March 28,\\n2019 using the accelerated attribution method, of $72.7 million. This was offset by a $22.9 million charge related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity\\nawards for employees who were terminated, resulting in a net stock-based compensation benefit of $49.8 million. Additionally, the Company recognized other\\nrestructuring charges including severance and other employee costs of $32.1 million as well as lease termination and other restructuring charges of $3.1 million. As\\na result of the above, the Company recognized a net restructuring benefit of $14.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  above  restructuring  related  charges  (benefits)  by  line  item  within  the  Company’s  consolidated  statements  of\\noperations where they were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\\n(1)\\n123\\nStock-Based\\nCompensation Benefit\\nSeverance and Other\\nEmployee Costs\\nLease Termination and\\nOther Costs\\nTotal\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n(4,237)\\n$\\n2,010 \\n$\\n1,529 \\n$\\n(698)\\nOperation and support\\n(2,830)\\n8,281 \\n1,060 \\n6,511 \\nResearch and development\\n(37,082)\\n11,706 \\n— \\n(25,376)\\nSales and marketing\\n(1,626)\\n3,071 \\n— \\n1,445 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n(4,031)\\n7,062 \\n539 \\n3,570 \\nTotal\\n$\\n(49,806)\\n$\\n32,130 \\n$\\n3,128 \\n$\\n(14,548)\\nNovember 2020 Restructuring Plan\\nIn November 2020, the Company announced an additional restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing\\neconomic  challenges  resulting  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its  impact  on  the  Company’s  business.  As  a  result  of  the  restructuring  plan,  which  was\\nsubstantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a severance and other employee costs of $1.5 million. This was offset by a stock\\nbased compensation benefit of $0.1 million due to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards for employees who were terminated. As a result, the Company\\nrecognized net restructuring costs of $1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, the remaining liability for restructuring related costs was immaterial.\\n \\n124\\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\\nNone.\\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end\\nof  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.  Based  on  such  evaluation,  our  principal  executive  officer  and  principal  financial  officer  have\\nconcluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-\\n15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\\nOur management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\\ninternal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2020  based  on  the  framework  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  (2013),  issued  by  the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial\\nreporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\\nThe  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2020  has  been  audited  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  an\\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of\\nthe Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our\\ninternal  control over financial  reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter  how well designed and operated, can provide only\\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are\\nresource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities\\nthat judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented\\nby the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also\\nbased in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals\\nunder all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\\nItem 9B. Other Information.\\nNone.\\n125\\nPART III\\nItem 10.

In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand\\nridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United\\nStates and Canada.\\nWe believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this\\nmassive societal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and\\nin select cities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while\\nproviding drivers using our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we\\nbelieve there is a massive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.\\nWe are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the\\n“Lyft Platform”) that powers rides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a\\nsignificant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network is\\nwell positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.\\nToday, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light\\nVehicles”) for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters\\nwho want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership. Additionally, for\\nthose Lyft riders who have a car, we also offer car maintenance, roadside assistance, and parking to meet them where they are in their transportation journey.\\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions from\\ndrivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue from\\nriders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive, Lyft Rentals renters, car owners that use services available in the Lyft app, and by making\\nour ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Lyft Pass programs. In the second quarter of\\n2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements. In 2022, we began generating revenues from the sale of bikes and bike station software\\nand hardware sales substantially through our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc (“PBSC”).\\nWe have made focused and substantial investments in support of our mission. For example, to continually launch new innovations on our platform, we have\\ninvested heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,\\ncultivate a differentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a\\npowerful multimodal platform and scaled user network.\\nTo advance our mission, we aim to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental\\nresponsibility. We believe that our brand represents freedom at your fingertips: freedom from the stresses of car ownership and freedom to do and see more. Through\\nour LyftUp initiatives, we’re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip\\ncode. We are also proud to be leaders in the fight against climate change. We’ve made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (“EVs”) on the Lyft network by\\nthe end of 2030. We believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility.\\nOur values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing\\nservices, including a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every\\ntime. As we recover from the impacts of COVID-19, we remain confident the demand for our offerings will continue to grow as more and more people discover new\\nways to experience Lyft, such as our bike and scooter offerings and even Lyft Pink, which offers riders exclusive perks and benefits.\\n5\\nImpact of COVID-19 to our Business\\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact communities globally. In March 2020, when it became apparent that COVID-19 was a pandemic,\\ngovernments and private businesses - at the recommendation of public health officials - began enacting precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel\\nrestrictions and social distancing measures in many regions of the United States and Canada where we operate. Many enterprises instituted and maintained work from\\nhome programs and limited the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased\\ndemand for our platform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform.\\nRelative to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, we\\'ve seen a significant improvement in demand and in the health of our marketplace. The extent to\\nwhich our operations will continue to be impacted by the pandemic and related changes in work, travel and lifestyle trends will depend largely on future developments,\\nwhich are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge.\\nFor more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I. For more information on the\\nimpact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in\\nItem 7 of Part II.\\nOur Transportation Network\\nOur transportation network is comprised of:\\n•\\nRidesharing Marketplace. Our core offering connects drivers with riders. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively incentivize\\ndrivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer convenient rides for\\nriders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in cities across the United States\\nand in select cities in Canada. In 2022, we launched Lyft Maps in an effort to optimize routing, improve safety, save riders and drivers time and add to our\\nmarketplace efficiency. In addition to our standard rideshare offering, riders can select a variety of other rideshare offerings which include Wait & Save, Lux,\\nLux Black, Lux Black XL, and have access to Lyft Pink, Lyft’s transportation-focused membership.\\n•\\nExpress Drive. Our car rental program for drivers, including those who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our\\nrequirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into rental agreements with our independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, and our\\nrental car partners for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform.\\n•\\nLyft Rentals. In 2019, we launched Lyft Rentals to offer a rental car option for users who have long-distance trips. Lyft Rentals is consumer facing and is\\ntherefore different from Express Drive, which is driver facing. Lyft Rentals is supported entirely by third-party partnerships.\\n•\\nLight Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for\\noptions that are more active and often more cost-effective and efficient for shorter trips. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-mile of a\\nmultimodal trip with public transit.\\n•\\nPublic Transit. Available in select cities, our Transit offering integrates third-party public transit data into the Lyft App to offer users a robust view of\\ntransportation options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is\\nanother step toward providing effective, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected\\ntransportation network.\\n•\\nLyft Autonomous. Our partnership with Motional has enabled the commercial deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. In\\nJuly 2021, we completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related\\nto our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate the safety and\\ncommercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing.\\nDrivers\\nThe drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We\\nwork hard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to drive on their own flexible terms while providing them the opportunity to focus their\\ntime on what matters most. Key benefits to drivers on our platform include:\\n•\\nFlexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.\\n•\\nTechnology. Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to drive to\\nmaximize their earnings on a real-time basis.\\n6\\n•\\nTransparent and Consistent Pay: We\\'ve released multiple features over the years aimed at providing transparency to drivers, including upfront pay, which\\nenables drivers to see ride information and what they’ll earn before accepting a ride, and Weekly Pay Statement, which gives drivers a more clear and\\ncomprehensive view of earnings details.\\n•\\nInsurance. We procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents\\nwhile on the platform.\\n•\\nCommunity Standards. To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked\\nthrough the Lyft App.\\n•\\nSupport. We offer drivers access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.\\nRiders\\nRiders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from\\nwork, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated, riders are\\npassengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile, or have used services for car owners\\navailable in the Lyft App. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their\\ntransportation network of choice. Key benefits to riders on our platform include:\\n•\\nSelection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently matches\\nriders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. Additional modes,\\nsuch as Light Vehicles, offer riders more options for shorter trips. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders\\npersonalized experiences most suitable to the trip being planned.\\n•\\nAvailability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and riders\\nconnect efficiently and reduce wait times.\\n•\\nAffordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time.\\n•\\nSafety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative products,\\npolicies and processes.\\nBusiness\\nLyft is evolving how businesses large and small take care of their people’s transportation needs across sectors including corporate, healthcare, auto, education\\nand government. Our comprehensive set of solutions allows clients to design, manage and pay for ground transportation programs that contribute to productivity and\\nsatisfaction while reducing cost and streamlining operations.\\nOur Technology Infrastructure and Operations\\nWe organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design. We\\nfocus on affordability, reliability, efficiency, optimization and cohesion when developing our software. Our offerings are mobile-first and platform agnostic. We seek to\\ncontinuously improve the Lyft Platform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks in demand.\\nWe have a commercial agreement with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of our partnership,\\nwe believe we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Refer to Note 9 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the\\nconsolidated financial statements for information regarding this agreement.\\nWe designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Both incremental and full backups are\\nperformed and redundant copies of content are stored independently in separate geographic regions. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our\\ndata privacy and security foundation, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies.\\nOur Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform\\nOur robust technology platform powers the millions of rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform in real-\\ntime. We leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets covering the ride\\nlifecycle, from when drivers go online and riders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the rides. Utilizing machine\\nlearning capabilities to predict future behavior based on many years of historical data and use cases, we employ various levers to balance supply and demand in the\\n7\\nmarketplace, creating increased driver earnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data science and algorithms to inform our\\nproduct development.\\nOur Intellectual Property\\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license\\nagreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills\\nand ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and offerings are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in ridesharing, autonomous vehicle-\\nrelated technology, micro-mobility, telecommunications, networking and other technologies relevant to our business. We hold numerous issued and pending patents in\\nthe U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we seek to register our brand names and product names, taglines and\\nlogos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks. In\\naddition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.lyft.com and other variations.\\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect\\nour intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For additional information, see the sections\\ntitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Claims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property\\nrights could harm our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could\\nharm our business, financial condition and results of operations.”\\nOur Growth Strategy\\nTransportation represents a massive market opportunity, one that we are in the very early stages of addressing. Our key growth strategies include our plans to:\\n•\\nIncrease Rider Use Cases. We are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offer\\nproducts to simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services\\nand university ride smart programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable\\norganizations to manage the transportation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.\\n•\\nGrow Active Riders. We see opportunities to continue to grow our rider base. We may make incremental investments in our brand and in growth marketing to\\nmaintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We strive to provide a full range of price points and ride experiences such as Wait & Save, which\\nallows riders to save money by waiting for a ride, and Priority Pickup, which provides a premium experience by allowing riders to pay for prioritized pickup.\\nWe plan to continue to grow our ridesharing marketplace by prioritizing competitive service levels and attracting and retaining more drivers and riders on our\\nnetwork. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand our network coverage beyond the geographies and markets we currently serve. We also\\nbelieve we are a beneficiary of demographic shifts, such as the growing percentage of the U.S. population that is accustomed to on-demand services and has\\ndigital-first preferences.\\n•\\nGrow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft network\\nspans rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to\\ndeliver the best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.\\n•\\nDeliver Increasing Value to Drivers. We strive to provide drivers that use Lyft with the best possible experience, including access to a variety of economic\\nopportunities. For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We also provide drivers with\\na suite of resources, including access to our on-demand, 24/7 support through our Driver app, to ensure drivers have the resources they need before taking the\\nroad. By making the driver experience better and better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft’s network.\\n•\\nInvest in our Marketplace Technology. Our investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers\\nand riders. Our mapping technology, now known as Lyft Maps, optimizes routing, in-app navigation, and user matching to improve the rider and driver\\nexperience and our marketplace efficiency. Additional investments in our payments and data science capabilities have been central to making our network\\nmore efficient and seamless to use.\\n8\\n•\\nThoughtfully Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. We have from time to time made strategic acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Bikeshare\\nHoldings LLC (“Motivate”), the largest bike sharing platform in the United States at the time, Flexdrive, LLC (“Flexdrive”), one of our longstanding Express\\nDrive partners, and PBSC, a global leader in bikeshare that supplies stations and bikes to markets internationally. We will continue to selectively consider\\nacquisitions that contribute to the growth of our current business, help us expand into adjacent markets or add new capabilities to our network. In addition, we\\ncontinue to expand our commercial partnerships. We believe drivers and riders will continue to benefit from a broad partner ecosystem that builds on our\\nexisting loyalty and reward programs. We have also built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and local governments, and technology\\nsolutions providers and we intend to continue to pursue partnerships that contribute to our growth.\\nCompetition\\nThe market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting levels of supply and demand and frequent\\nintroductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-\\nestablished and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely\\nmanner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other ridesharing transportation network companies\\nand taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market include Lime, Bird,\\nFifteen and Tier. Our main competitors in the vehicle rental market include Enterprise and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces. We also\\ncompete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly in markets outside of the United States.\\nAdditionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, non-ridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive\\nmanufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology and TaaS\\nofferings that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple, Aurora, Baidu, General Motors (Cruise), Motional, and Tesla as\\nwell as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from\\nnew entrants into the TaaS market.\\nWe believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer\\noperating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the\\ndevelopment of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to\\nOperational Factors—We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.”\\nSeasonality\\nThe revenue we generate from our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays. Demand\\nfor our transportation network has historically declined over the winter season and demand for our network of Light Vehicles has historically increased during more\\ntemperate and dry seasons.\\nOur Brand and Marketing\\nWe believe good energy moves the world. The Lyft brand is rooted in our hospitality principles: safety, simplicity, reliability, care, and delight. Our marketing\\nefforts bring our brand to life across a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct communications like email and\\nsocial media engagement. We also benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider and driver communities.\\nOur marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential drivers and\\nriders. Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships, and outdoor\\nadvertisements. We use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend. We attract new drivers and riders through referrals,\\npartnerships, display advertising, radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more. We continue to engage with\\ncurrent riders through a variety of initiatives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.\\nOur Commitment to Safety\\nA strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with drivers and\\nriders on our platform, and we take significant measures every day that are focused on their safety.\\n9\\nTo ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding high quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC\\n(formerly known as Customer Experience and Trust), team as a key part of our organization. SCC is in charge of fielding safety and customer support inquiries and is\\navailable through multiple channels, including via self-service and assisted support directly within our apps. SCC aims to eliminate bad customer experiences, quickly\\nresolve problems when they occur and maintain trust with drivers and riders. This dedication led our customer support to be recently named number one in Newsweek’s\\n2022 America’s Best Customer Service rankings for the E-mobility category.\\nSome measures we take to promote the safety of riders and drivers on the platform include:\\n•\\nAnnual background checks and ongoing criminal monitoring. Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered criminal background check before\\nthey drive and each year after that. In the United States, continuous criminal monitoring allows us to quickly deactivate drivers with disqualifying criminal\\nconvictions. Similarly, in the United States, we also continuously check driving records so that we can promptly identify and remove drivers from the platform\\nupon detection of a disqualifying violation.\\n•\\nShare location. The Lyft app provides real-time ride tracking, so riders can share their exact location and route with family and friends. Once a user enables\\nthis feature, a user’s trusted contacts (who they shared their location with) can see trip status and where they are on the map.\\n•\\nEmergency help, supported by ADT. If a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with\\nan ADT security professional, silently or by voice. If someone signals they need help and subsequently does not respond to a call or text from ADT, ADT will\\ncontact 911 and share the user’s location and other relevant information.\\n•\\nSmart trip check-in. We monitor rides, and in some instances, if we notice a ride irregularity, we reach out to riders and drivers directly. We will ask the rider\\nor driver if they need help, and, if appropriate, connect them to emergency assistance or our own Safety team.\\n•\\nHidden contact information and ride history. The Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride. While\\nriders and drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, including real user phone numbers, are not revealed. Drivers are\\nalso not able to see a rider’s drop-off location, whether it’s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.\\n•\\nTwo-way ratings and feedback. At the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider or driver\\nwho submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details. Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will never be matched\\nwith that individual again through the app.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as\\nTNCs, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker\\nconfidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property,\\nsecurities, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver\\nprovisions, terms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-\\nemergency medical transportation, healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health,\\nanti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign\\nexchange controls and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to\\nvarying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial\\ndecisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\\nThe TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specifically\\nincreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, California passed first-of-its-kind legislation (the “California Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program”) to\\nmandate that TNCs reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis, with additional requirements that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission\\nvehicles on their platforms. Policymakers recently passed analogous legislation in Massachusetts and are considering similar rules in Oregon and New York City.\\nSee the section titled “Risk Factors,” including the subsection titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors” for additional information\\nabout the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.\\nHuman Capital\\n10\\nOur employees are our human capital and, together with our technology stack, are our greatest strength and most valuable resource. In early 2022, we\\nimplemented our flexible workplace strategy. A majority of employees were offered flexibility to work from an office location, home, or a hybrid combination that\\nempowers them to do their best work. As of December\\xa031, 2022, we had 4,419 employees and we maintain additional offices in multiple locations in the U.S. and\\ninternationally in Montreal, Canada, Munich, Germany and Minsk, Belarus. Approximately 41% of our employees work in our product management, engineering,\\ndesign and science organizations.\\nWe believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more\\nour employees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December\\xa031, 2022, our employee base was\\n58% male and 40% female, and women represented 40% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or\\nLatinx, 8% Black, and 6% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity\\ninformation is based on self-identification, and employees who did not disclose their gender or ethnicity have been excluded from the applicable disclosure. As of\\nDecember\\xa0 31, 2022, employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity\\nrepresented approximately 1% of total U.S. employees.\\nWe strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, develop\\ntalent internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We are continuing to focus on scaling and sustaining diverse partnerships and early candidate pipeline\\ndevelopment as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization. In 2021, we set forth a road map and strategy to\\nestablish, launch and pilot new tools, partnerships, and outreach programs and in 2022, we implemented our roadmap strategy and held partnership events with\\nBreakLine, Tribaja, and Disability:IN. We increased representation through our sourcing tool, hireEZ, and held disability and inclusion training for team members with\\nthe Inclusively and Direct Employers organizations.\\nWe also include additional team member information in our 2022 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report, which is available on our website.\\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\\nIn October 2022, we released our 2022 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report. We began publishing this report in 2020 and intend to\\ncontinue to prepare this report annually to make available key information about our work toward environmental, social, and economic issues.\\nEnvironmental\\nA world built around people, not cars. This is one of Lyft’s most powerful ideas: cities defined by public spaces that bring us together, not pavement and\\nparking spots. Creating the transportation system that enables this is a big and long-term challenge — and it’s the one we wake up excited to work on every day. Our\\nteam operates with an authentic mission to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation. This mission shows up in a hundred different ways in the cities\\nand communities we serve: in the ways we bring people together socially, offer economic independence, and take care of our planet. We work to meet each of these\\nmoments with integrity, humanity, and hospitality.\\nBy making bikes and scooters easily available on our multimodal platform, and scaling ebikes as part of our shared fleets, we have empowered riders with\\naffordable, convenient, and more sustainable ways to get around without cars. Today, we operate over 90,000 bikes and scooters across 10 markets in partnership with\\ncity governments and with our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions in 2022, have an additional 100,000+ bikes deployed in bikeshare systems in 46 markets in 15\\ncountries.\\nBecause we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft made the commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of\\n2030. This is in line with the Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program which was approved by the California Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target\\nthat 90% of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by 2030 and recently announced goals in New York City to get to 100% of rideshare miles in EVs by 2030.\\nIn 2021, Lyft continued to forge its path to 100% EVs by focusing on expanding on the Express Drive rental vehicle partner platform, advancing pilot\\nprograms to improve access to EVs and EV charging infrastructure, and advocating for public policies that will accelerate EV adoption. Additionally, in December\\n2022, Lyft announced a suite of offerings and partnerships to help drivers switch to EVs. The new offerings include a weekly earnings incentive for EV drivers,\\ncashback on public EV charging, EV fast-charging discounts, and a Lyft-specific discount on home charging hardware and installation. We have also transitioned half\\nof our driver rental rides to hybrid vehicles.\\nSocial\\nRiders of all incomes and identities— including those who have been historically underserved—rely on the Lyft platform when they need a ride.\\nWe approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on\\ntrust, respect and a common objective of improving people’s lives by improving transportation.\\n11\\nThrough our LyftUp initiative, we aim to bridge the most serious transportation gaps across the U.S. by partnering with nonprofit organizations and governments to\\nprovide access to free and discounted transportation to individuals and families in need. In 2022, we estimate that we provided access to over 4.6 million discounted or\\ndonated car, bike and scooter rides to help under-resourced communities access key resources. Current LyftUp programs include:\\n•\\nJobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job to give unemployed and underemployed\\nindividuals a fairer chance at success;\\n•\\nGrocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for individuals living in food-insecure areas to help ensure that transportation is not a barrier to\\nhealthy food;\\n•\\nVaccine Access - provides rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for at-risk communities;\\n•\\nVoting Access - provides rides to the polls during Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such as\\nseniors, veterans and communities of color.\\n•\\nDisaster Response - provides rides to support communities in the aftermath of natural or manmade disasters.\\n•\\nBikeshare Access - provides discounted bikeshare memberships and heavily discounted electric bike rides to income eligible riders across all Lyft-operated\\nbikeshare systems.\\nSince 2017, our riders have been making their rides count for their community by rounding up their ride payments and donating the difference to an\\norganization of their choice. To date, riders have donated more than $30 million to support nonprofits and communities across the U.S. and Canada.\\nCorporate Governance\\nOur board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company\\'s direction and ensure it is operating\\nwith the utmost business integrity. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement\\nfor our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\\nCorporate Information\\nWe were incorporated in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc., a Delaware corporation.

disrupt and harm, our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will continue to adversely impact our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\\nOur business, operations and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, such as\\ntravel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. The pandemic, these responses and the related effects continue to evolve and have caused, and could continue\\nto cause, a number of impacts to our business and our platform, including, but not limited to, those discussed below.\\n•\\nThe pandemic has led to declines in certain travel, including commuting and business and leisure travel, resulting in decreased demand for our platform and\\nunpredictable earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. While travel has recovered to some degree, overall levels remain depressed and shifts towards\\nremote or hybrid work environments, or other\\n15\\nbehavioral changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have negatively impacted the frequency and nature of demand for travel, including commuting and\\nbusiness travel, and may reduce our long-term market opportunity. Additionally, the recovery of the economy and demand for our platform has varied by\\ngeography and certain markets where we have historically seen significant demand have been, and may continue to be, slow to recover or grow.\\n•\\nDriver behaviors have also shifted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to imbalanced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider\\ndemand at times in certain markets. Limited driver availability has negatively impacted service levels, which led us to provide additional incentives to attract\\nand retain drivers, and has also decreased demand for vehicles rented to drivers through our Express Drive program.\\n•\\nWe have also modified our business practices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including by permitting corporate employees in nearly all of our\\nlocations to work remotely, limiting employee travel, adopting safety precautions for and holding virtual events and meetings. These shifts have led us to\\nreduce our real estate footprint and may increase the risk of a cybersecurity breach or incident, result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture,\\nadversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our financial statements or maintain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business,\\nour financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n•\\nIn response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we have taken certain cost-cutting measures, including reductions-in-force, which may\\nhave adversely affected employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees.\\n•\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted our business operations relating to our Light Vehicles, our Express Drive program, and our autonomous vehicle\\npartners. We design and contract to manufacture Light Vehicles and certain assets related to our network of shared Light Vehicles and have faced delays in\\nmanufacturing and delivery as well as increased costs associated with manufacturing and shipping. Our ability to operate the Express Drive program has been\\nnegatively impacted as a result of mandated closures from time to time, limited staffing availability, and increased costs for us to operate rental sites and for\\nFlexdrive to transport, repossess, clean, and store unrented and returned vehicles. Further, the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology has been\\nimpacted both by direct impacts from the pandemic on health and safety conditions and shelter-in-place restrictions, as well as decisions by current or potential\\npartners to reduce investments in developing and deploying autonomous vehicle-related technology due to macroeconomic factors.\\n•\\nThese impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue and additional impacts due to new developments in the COVID-19 pandemic or the responses thereto\\nmay affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, riders and drivers on\\nour platform, and our business partners will depend on many factors outside of our control, such as governmental responses to the pandemic, shifts in\\nconsumer or business behavior and macroeconomic factors directly or indirectly related to the pandemic.\\n•\\nIn light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we cannot be certain of the extent of the future negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic\\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nA deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nOur business and results of operations are subject to global economic conditions. Deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or\\nrecession, inflation, increases to fuel and other energy costs or vehicle costs, changes in the labor market or decreases in consumer spending power or confidence, are\\nlikely to result in decreased discretionary spending and reduced demand for our platform. Further, changes in corporate spending, including cost-cuts and layoffs, may\\nadversely impact business travel, commuting and other business related expenditures. In addition, inflation and higher interest rates, increased fuel and other energy\\ncosts, increased labor and benefits costs and increased insurance costs have, and may continue to, put pressure on economic conditions, which has led, and could lead,\\nto greater operating expenses. For example, inflation has increased and is expected to further increase medical costs and vehicle repair costs, including increased prices\\nof new and used vehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, which has resulted in increases in our insurance costs. Similarly, these factors, as well\\nas increased fuel costs, increase costs as well as costs for drivers on our platform. . Many of these factors are out of our control and make it difficult to accurately\\nforecast revenues and operating results, particularly in the long-term, and could negatively affect our ability to meet our target operating performance and our (and our\\nstrategic partners’) ability to make decisions about future investments. Further, we may need to make changes to our business to respond to these conditions and be able\\nto compete effectively. For example, as a result of the increase in gas prices at certain points in 2022, in order to support drivers on our platform, we implemented a\\ntemporary per ride fuel surcharge in most markets, which we removed in September 2022. Similarly, we have adjusted our pricing in response to competitive pressures\\ncaused by changes in our marketplace, which we expect will result in declines in our revenue. An economic downturn resulting in a prolonged recessionary period\\nwould likely have a further adverse effect on our revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\\n16\\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.\\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile networks,\\nthe Internet or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region\\nknown for seismic activity and increasingly for fires. The impact of climate change may increase these risks. In addition, any public health crises, such as the COVID-\\n19 pandemic, other epidemics, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political or social instability and other geopolitical developments, or other\\ncatastrophic events, whether in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. For example, we have offices and\\nemployees in Belarus and Ukraine that have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the current war in the region, including displacement of our employees.\\nThe impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or our third-party providers’ abilities could result in driver supply and rider demand\\nimbalances, decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, or increase our costs and operating expenses, which could adversely affect\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be\\ninadequate.\\nRisks Related to Operational Factors\\nOur limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\\nWhile we have primarily focused on ridesharing since our ridesharing marketplace launched in 2012, our business continues to evolve. We regularly expand\\nour platform features, offerings and services and change our pricing methodologies. In recent periods, we have also reevaluated and changed our cost structure and\\nfocused our business model. Through the acquisition of PBSC we have expanded our business to include licensing of certain of our technology and sales of bikes and\\nstations. Our evolving business, industry and markets make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks and\\nchallenges we have faced or expect to face include our ability to:\\n•\\nforecast our revenue and operating results and budget for and manage our expenses;\\n•\\nattract new qualified drivers and new riders, and retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders in a cost-effective manner;\\n•\\neffectively and competitively price our services and determine appropriate pricing methodologies;\\n•\\ncomply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;\\n•\\nmanage our platform and our business assets and expenses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments, including changes in rider behavior\\nand demand for our services;\\n•\\nplan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future offerings, including our network of Light Vehicles and certain vehicles in the Express\\nDrive program, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future offerings;\\n•\\ndevelop, manufacture, source, deploy, sell, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles, our Driver Hub, and certain\\nvehicles in the Express Drive program;\\n•\\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in market dynamics in the markets in which we operate;\\n•\\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\\n•\\neffectively manage our growth and business operations, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business;\\n•\\nsuccessfully expand our geographic reach;\\n•\\nhire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\\n•\\nsuccessfully develop new platform features, offerings and services to enhance the experience of users; and\\n•\\nright-size our real estate portfolio.\\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in\\nthis “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have an evolving financial\\nmodel and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a static\\nfinancial model or operated in a more predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently\\nexperienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we\\nuse to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks\\n17\\nsuccessfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\nOur financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\\nPrior to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined significantly,\\nthough it has since recovered, the timeline for a full recovery of rideshare demand, driver supply and other aspects of our business in each of our markets is uncertain.\\nAccordingly, our recent revenue growth rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the decline related to COVID-19 and recent growth\\nrates compared to periods in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, may not be indicative of our future performance. Further, we have incurred net losses each year\\nsince our inception, and we expect that our financial performance, including Adjusted EBITDA, will continue to fluctuate in future periods. We can provide no\\nassurances that we will achieve or maintain Adjusted EBITDA profitability in the future, on a quarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a\\nGAAP basis.\\nWhile we remain focused on operating efficiently, our expenses will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform\\nfeatures, expand in existing and new markets and continue to invest in our platform and customer engagement. In addition, certain costs, such as insurance and driver\\npay and incentives have increased or fluctuated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic factors and the development and maturation of our business and\\nthe rideshare industry and may continue to do so. We may be unable to accurately predict these costs and our investments may not result in increased revenue or growth\\nin our business. For example, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with the passage of Proposition 22 in California and\\nHB 2076 in Washington, including providing drivers in these states with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards on-the-job injury\\ninsurance, other benefits and minimum guaranteed earnings. Due to various factors, including inflation, we anticipate that our insurance costs will increase and will\\nimpact our profitability. Furthermore, we have expanded over time to include more asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, Flexdrive and Lyft\\nCar Maintenance. We have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030. These offerings and\\nprograms require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if\\nwe are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets, such offerings are otherwise not successful or we decide to shut down any such offerings, our\\ninvestments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, any\\nlegal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations\\n(including potentially suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and\\ngrow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability\\nin the future. Additionally, stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and other equity awards is expected to continue to be a\\nsignificant expense in future periods, and as of December 31, 2022, we had $499.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs, net of\\nestimated forfeitures, that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.0 years. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace\\nwith our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to\\nsuccessfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nAs our business recovers from the effects of COVID-19 and we endeavor to return to pre-COVID-19 financial performance, our revenue growth rates and\\nresults of operations will fluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, changes in the\\nmacroeconomic environment, slowing demand for our offerings, increasing competition or changes in market dynamics, a decrease in the growth of our overall market\\nor market saturation, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our business model and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. If we\\nare unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve or\\nmaintain profitability.\\nWe face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nThe market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting levels of supply and demand and frequent\\nintroductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-\\nestablished and enjoy greater resources or other strategic or technological advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to competitive challenges in a\\ntimely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience fluctuations or a decline in market share, a decline in revenue or\\ngrowth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our market share has fluctuated over time and we may need to\\ntake actions that have negative impacts on our financial results in the short term, either because of decreased revenue or increased investments, or both, that we believe\\nwill benefit our company in the long term.\\n18\\nOur main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other transportation network companies and taxi cab\\nand livery companies, as well as traditional automotive manufacturers and technology companies. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market include\\nLime, Bird, Fifteen and Tier. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly in markets\\noutside of the United States. Our main competitors in the consumer vehicle rental market include Enterprise and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share\\nmarketplaces.\\nAdditionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, bike and scooter sharing companies, consumer vehicle rental companies, non-\\nridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of\\ncompanies developing autonomous vehicle technology and TaaS offerings that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox),\\nApple, Aurora, Baidu, General Motors (Cruise), Motional, and Tesla as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We\\nanticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.\\nCertain of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, research and development, manufacturing and other\\nresources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories or a larger user base than we do. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development,\\npromotion and sale of offerings and offer lower prices than we do, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, they may have greater resources to\\ndeploy towards the research, development and commercialization of new technologies, including autonomous vehicle technology or Light Vehicles, or they may have\\nother financial, technical or resource advantages. These factors may allow our competitors or potential competitors to derive greater revenue and profits from their\\nexisting user bases, attract and retain qualified drivers and riders at lower costs, offer more attractive pricing on their platforms or respond more quickly to new and\\nemerging technologies and trends. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative or strategic relationships, or consolidate, amongst themselves\\nor with third parties that may further enhance their resources and offerings.\\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, and if we are unable to compete\\nsuccessfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur results of operations vary and are unpredictable from period-to-period, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of\\nreasons, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-\\nyear, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that may cause our results of\\noperations to fluctuate in this “Risk Factors” section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other\\nprojections, or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\\nThe ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, are still in relatively early stages of growth and development\\nand if such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nPrior to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to\\ngrow, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is relatively new and\\nunproven, and it is uncertain whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success will depend to a\\nsubstantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings across a variety of use cases. We cannot be certain whether the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact the willingness of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or the willingness of riders to use shared bikes\\nor scooters, or whether lasting impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased remote work opportunities, will otherwise limit market growth. In addition, we\\npaused our shared rides offerings (though we relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021), and we were temporarily restricted from\\noperating our scooter share program in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently\\ndiscontinued operations due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. In the event of a resurgence of COVID-19 or other events beyond our control, we may be\\nrequired or believe it is advisable to suspend such offerings again. If the public does not perceive ridesharing or our other offerings as beneficial, or chooses not to\\nadopt them as a result of concerns regarding public health or safety, affordability or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our\\ncompetitors’ platforms, the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, then the market for our offerings may not further develop, may develop more slowly than we expect or\\nmay not achieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we re-evaluate the markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of\\nLight Vehicles, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and\\nchallenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n19\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers on our platform, or to increase the utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and\\nto increase their utilization of our platform. To attract and retain qualified drivers, we have, among other things, offered\\xa0sign-up\\xa0and referral bonuses and provided\\naccess to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. Drivers are generally able to switch between our\\nplatform and competing platforms. If we do not continue to provide drivers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to increase earnings and other\\nincentive programs, such as demand-based bonuses, that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry, or\\nif drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits or our requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to\\nattract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilization of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work\\nstoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a shortage of available drivers relative\\nto rider demand in certain markets and offered increased incentives to improve driver supply. To the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offer\\nincreased incentives to improve supply, our revenue and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in\\nCalifornia, drivers have been able to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and\\nregulations, which would likely increase our expenses. Ongoing litigation seeking to reclassify drivers as employees is pending in multiple jurisdictions, including as\\ndescribed in the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K. If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we may be required to classify drivers as employees rather than independent contractors in those\\njurisdictions. If this occurs, we may need to develop and implement an employment model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether\\ntemporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risks relating to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-\\nparty organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employee drivers to meet rider demand.\\nIf drivers are unsatisfied with our partners, including our third-party vehicle rental partners, our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and to increase\\ntheir utilization of our platform could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to attract drivers could fail to attract and retain qualified drivers or fail to\\nincrease utilization, or could have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and\\nemployment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool of qualified drivers, which may result in increased competition for\\nqualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and retention. As part of our business operations or research and development efforts, data on the vehicle may\\nbe collected and drivers may be uncomfortable or unwilling to drive knowing that data is being collected. Other factors outside of our control, such as the COVID-19\\npandemic, concerns about personal health and safety, increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles or insurance, or concerns about the availability of government or other\\nassistance programs if drivers continue to drive on our platform, may also reduce the number of drivers on our platform or their utilization of our platform, or impact\\nour ability to onboard new drivers. If we fail to attract qualified drivers on favorable terms, fail to increase their utilization of our platform or lose qualified drivers to\\nour competitors, we may not be able to meet the demand of riders, including maintaining a competitive price of rides to riders, and our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract new riders, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing riders, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be harmed.\\nOur success depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract new riders, retain existing riders and increase utilization of our platform by current riders.\\nRiders have a wide variety of options for transportation, including personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit and other ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing\\nofferings. Rider preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our rider base, we must appeal to new riders who have historically used other forms of\\ntransportation or other ridesharing or bike and scooter sharing platforms. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our\\nofferings, which in turn drives new rider growth and rider utilization. However, our reputation, brand and ability to build trust with existing and new riders may be\\nadversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our offerings, our policies, including our pricing algorithms and pricing policies, drivers on our\\nplatform, or our competitors, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Further, if existing and new riders do not perceive the transportation services\\nprovided by drivers on our platform to be reliable, safe and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant offerings and features on our platform, we may not be able\\nto attract or retain riders or to increase their utilization of our platform. As we continue to expand into new geographic areas, we will be relying in part on referrals from\\nour existing riders to attract new riders, and therefore we must ensure that our existing riders remain satisfied with our offerings. In addition, we have experienced and\\nmay continue to experience seasonality in both ridesharing and Light Vehicle rentals during the winter months, which may harm our ability to attract and retain riders\\nduring such periods. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the utilization of our platform by riders and may continue to affect utilization of our platform by\\nriders, including longer term. If we fail to continue to grow our rider base, retain existing riders or increase the overall utilization of our platform by existing riders, we\\nmay not be able to provide drivers with an adequate level of ride requests, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In\\naddition, if we do not achieve sufficient utilization of our asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, our business, financial condition and results\\nof operations could be adversely affected.\\n20\\nWe rely substantially on our wholly-owned subsidiary and deductibles to insure auto-related risks and on third-party insurance policies to insure and reinsure our\\noperations-related risks. If our insurance or reinsurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their\\nobligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nFrom the time a driver becomes available to accept rides in the Lyft Driver App until the driver logs off and is no longer available to accept rides, we, through\\nour wholly-owned insurance subsidiary and deductibles, often bear substantial financial risk with respect to auto-related incidents, including auto liability, uninsured\\nand underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to\\ncertain limits. To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related risks, we procure a number of third-party\\ninsurance policies which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from\\ntime to time, of the auto-related risk from some third-party insurance providers. In connection with our reinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds into\\ntrust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which some third-party insurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. If we fail to comply with\\nstate insurance regulatory requirements or other regulations governing insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected. If any of our third-party insurance providers or administrators who handle the claim on behalf of the third-party insurance providers become insolvent, they\\ncould be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make.\\nWe also procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including employment practices liability, workers’ compensation,\\nbusiness interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability and general business liabilities, including product liability. For certain\\ntypes of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition,\\nwe may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving offerings, and we may have to pay\\nhigh premiums, self-insured retentions or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurance or reinsurance providers becomes insolvent, it\\ncould be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Certain losses may be excluded from insurance coverage including, but not limited to losses caused\\nby intentional act, pollution, contamination, virus, bacteria, terrorism, war and civil unrest.\\nThe amount of one or more auto-related claims or operations-related claims has exceeded and could continue to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage\\nlimits, for which we have borne and could continue to bear a portion of the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured\\nretentions or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many types of coverages and for a variety of\\ncommercial risks and are likely to do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expenses could increase, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-\\ninsured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced to manage pricing pressure. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected if (i)\\xa0cost per claim, premiums or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience, (ii)\\xa0we experience a claim in excess of our coverage\\nlimits, (iii)\\xa0our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv)\\xa0we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, (v)\\xa0the number of claims and\\naverage claim cost under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historic averages or (vi) an insurance policy is canceled or non-renewed.\\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses, and we\\nperiodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions and insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ\\nvarious predictive modeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on available historical experience and industry statistics to estimate our\\ninsurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective and speculative.\\nWhile an independent actuarial firm periodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness and provides claims reserve valuations, a number of external factors can\\naffect the actual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open, increases in healthcare costs, increases in\\nautomotive costs (including rental vehicles), legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nSuch factors can impact the reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves for claims incurred but not\\nyet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. The automotive insurance industry has experienced rising costs due to, among other\\nthings, inflation, supply chain challenges, and the increasing cost of medical care, which has driven an increase in actual losses in recent periods, and we expect these\\ncosts to continue to drive increased actual losses. Additionally, we have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, instances of insurance fraud, which\\ncould increase our actual insurance-related costs. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the\\naggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determine that our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may\\nbe required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined\\nand negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we have in the past experienced adverse development where we have\\n21\\nneeded to increase historical reserves attributable to liabilities in prior periods, and in the fourth quarter of 2022, we strengthened our insurance reserves and accrued\\nand other current liabilities by $375 million.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers for our auto-related insurance claims, and if such providers fail to service insurance claims\\nto our expectations or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers to service our auto-related claims. If any of our third-party insurance service providers\\nfails to service claims to our expectations, discontinues or increases the cost of coverage or changes the terms of such coverage in a manner not favorable to drivers or\\nto us, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage or services on reasonable terms in an acceptable time frame or at all. If we cannot find\\nalternate third-party insurance service providers on terms acceptable to us, we may incur additional expenses related to servicing such auto-related claims using internal\\nresources.\\nIn recent periods, the automotive insurance industry has experienced rising costs due to, among other things, inflation, supply chain challenges, and the cost of\\nmedical care, which has harmed our business, financial condition and results of operations, including through increased insurance renewal costs, and we expect it to\\ncontinue to negatively impact the automotive insurance industry and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe have, from time to time, sold portions of retained insurance risk to third-parties, including as described in the “Insurance Reserves” subheading in Note 6,\\nSupplemental Financial Statement Information to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These transactions may cause us\\nto incur additional expenses in the total cost of this risk, and we are subject to recapture of the risk if any third party reinsurer were to default on their reinsurance\\nobligation.\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party insurance service providers could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead\\nto increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur reputation, brand and the network effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are important to our success, and if we are not able to maintain and\\ncontinue developing our reputation, brand and network effects, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand as a safe, reliable and affordable platform and continuing to increase the strength of the network effects\\namong the drivers and riders on our platform are critical to our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders. The successful development of our reputation,\\nbrand and network effects will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Negative perception of our platform or company may harm our\\nreputation, brand and networks effects, including as a result of:\\n•\\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, drivers on our platform, riders, our product offerings, pricing or our policies and guidelines, including our practices\\nand policies with respect to drivers, or the ridesharing industry, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents;\\n•\\nillegal, negligent, reckless or otherwise inappropriate behavior by drivers or riders or third parties, or concerns about the safety of our platform or ridesharing\\nin general;\\n•\\na failure to provide drivers with a sufficient level of ride requests, charge drivers competitive fees and commissions or provide drivers with competitive fares\\nand incentives;\\n•\\na failure to offer riders competitive ride pricing and pick-up times or the desired range of ride types;\\n•\\nactual or perceived disruptions of or defects in our platform, such as privacy or data security breaches or incidents, site outages, payment disruptions or other\\nincidents that impact the reliability of our offerings;\\n•\\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform or our business;\\n•\\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies, changes to our policies that are negatively received, or a failure to enforce our policies in a\\nmanner perceived as effective, fair and transparent;\\n•\\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our stated values and mission, including modification or discontinuation of our community or\\nsustainability programs, illegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contracts, or negative perception of our\\ntreatment of employees;\\n•\\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support service experiences;\\n•\\nnegative responses by drivers or riders to new offerings on our platform;\\n22\\n•\\naccidents, defects or other negative incidents involving autonomous vehicles or Light Vehicles on our platform or Light Vehicles sold to third parties;\\n•\\npolitical or social policies or activities, including our response to employee sentiment related to these matters; or\\n•\\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects the public’s perception of us or our industry as a\\nwhole.\\nIf we do not successfully maintain and develop our brand, reputation and network effects and successfully differentiate our offerings from competitive\\nofferings, our business may not grow, we may not be able to compete effectively and we could lose existing qualified drivers or existing riders or fail to attract new\\nqualified drivers or new riders, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes we may make to\\nenhance and improve our offerings and balance the needs and interests of the drivers and riders on our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective\\n(such as riders) but negatively from another’s perspective (such as drivers), or may not be viewed positively by either drivers or riders. If we fail to balance the interests\\nof drivers and riders or make changes that they view negatively, drivers and riders may stop using our platform, take fewer rides or use alternative platforms, any of\\nwhich could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIllegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activity of users, whether or not occurring while utilizing our platform, has and could continue to expose us to liability\\nand harm our business, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIllegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities by users, including the activities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then\\nreceiving or providing services offered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating users of our platform could adversely affect our brand,\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. These activities may include assault, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing\\nof rider or driver accounts and other misconduct. While we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify and address the risk of these types of\\nactivities, these measures may not adequately address, and are unlikely to prevent, all illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activity by these parties from\\noccurring in connection with our offerings. Such conduct has and could continue to expose us to liability or adversely affect our brand or reputation. At the same time,\\nif the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all drivers undergo annual\\nbackground checks or our two-way rating system and related policies, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent qualified drivers and riders otherwise in good\\nstanding from using our offerings, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so,\\nthe growth and retention of the number of qualified drivers and riders on our platform and their utilization of our platform could be negatively impacted. Further, any\\nnegative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our platform, on our competitors’ platforms, or on any ridesharing platform, could\\nadversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of the ridesharing industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and\\npotentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential and existing drivers, and if such providers fail to provide accurate information, or if\\nproviders are unable to complete background checks because of data access restrictions, court closures or other unforeseen government shutdowns, or we do not\\nmaintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen the records of potential and existing drivers to help identify those that are not qualified to utilize\\nour platform pursuant to applicable laws or our internal standards. Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected to the extent we cannot attract or\\nretain qualified drivers as a result of such providers being unable to complete certain background checks, or being significantly delayed in completing certain\\nbackground checks, because of data access restrictions, or to the extent that they do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations or the requirements of\\napplicable laws or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time\\nframe. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential drivers, and as a\\nresult, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet\\nour expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, unqualified drivers may be permitted to provide rides on our platform, and as a result, our\\nreputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing drivers on our platform. If we or drivers on\\nour platform fail to comply with applicable laws, rules and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\n23\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to safety incidents or data security breaches or\\nincidences, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChanges to our pricing could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.\\nDemand for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we charge\\ndrivers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\\nstrategies including increased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-\\npriced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a\\nlower cost than we do. This includes the use of algorithms to set dynamic prices for riders and earnings for drivers that are dependent on various factors, such as the\\nroute, time of day, and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we have made pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both\\nrider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, through competition, regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for\\nriders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge the drivers on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other\\nexpenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. These actions may adversely affect our business and financial results and\\nmay not have the desired benefits. In addition, gas prices rose significantly at certain points in 2022 and in light of those costs, we implemented a temporary per ride\\nfuel surcharge in most markets, which we removed in September 2022. Furthermore, the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders on our platform may vary by\\ngeographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing\\nin certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local laws and regulations regarding pricing limitations during a government\\ndeclared State of Emergency, including those issued in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, have imposed limits on prices for certain services and certain local\\nregulations regarding minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and\\nSeattle. We have tested or launched, and expect to in the future test or launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription packages and driver or rider\\nloyalty programs. We have also modified, and expect to in the future modify, existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy. To the extent any\\nmodifications to our pricing methodologies lead to real or perceived harm to driver earnings, our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers may be adversely affected.\\nAny of the foregoing actions may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in loss of market share, negative\\npublic perception and harm to our reputation.\\nWhile we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may ultimately\\nbe unsuccessful. A determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a\\nridesharing platform as an employee, may require us to revise our pricing methodologies to account for such a change to driver classification. The passage of\\nProposition 22 in California and HB 2076 in Washington has enabled us to provide additional earning opportunities to drivers in those states, including guaranteed\\nearnings. The transition has, and will continue to, require additional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including\\nchanges to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, and may in the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates, fees and payment structure for drivers on our\\nplatform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers. Moreover, successful litigation to overturn Proposition 22, or the\\nreclassification of drivers on our platform as employees could reduce the available supply of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under\\nan employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices and balance supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not\\nbe accurate. We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future underpricing or overpricing of our offerings due to changes we make to the technology\\nused in our pricing. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. As we continue to launch new and\\ndevelop existing asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, our Driver Hub, and certain vehicles in our Express Drive program, factors such as\\nmaintenance, debt service, depreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect our pricing methodologies. In addition, we have established\\nenvironmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may also affect our pricing. Any such changes to our pricing\\nmethodologies or our ability to efficiently price our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we are unable to efficiently grow and further develop our network of Light Vehicles, which may not grow as we expect or become profitable over time, and\\nmanage the related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWhile some major cities have widely adopted bike and scooter sharing, there can be no assurance that new markets we enter will accept, or existing markets\\nwill continue to accept, bike and scooter sharing, and even if they do, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our related offerings will be\\nsuccessful in such markets. For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi\\nBike’s exclusivity, arguing that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco’s stations were in private garages. The City successfully obtained a preliminary\\n24\\ninjunction against Joco, and litigation is ongoing. A negative determination in other legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse\\ndetermination regarding our existing rights to operate, could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time\\nbe denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted from operating due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in\\ncertain jurisdictions. While we do not expect any denial or suspension in an individual region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate\\ncould adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we are able to successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be\\nheightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there could be negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including\\nthe overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving an increased number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety\\nof the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidents on our platform or incidents involving our competitors’ offerings.\\nWe design and contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of\\nbikes and scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be no assurance we\\nwill be able to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable basis, at a reasonable price or\\nat all. We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of Light Vehicles and we rely on a small number of suppliers, and in some\\ninstances a sole supplier, for components and manufacturing services.\\nThe revenue we generate from our network of Light Vehicles may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to, among other things, seasonal factors including\\nweather. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to assess the exact nature or extent of the effects of seasonality on our network of Light Vehicles,\\nhowever, we generally experience a decline in demand for our bike and scooter rentals over the winter season and an increase during more temperate and dry seasons.\\nAdditionally, from time to time we may re-evaluate the markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued\\nand may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. For example, in July and November 2022, we discontinued our shared\\nscooter programs in San Diego and Los Angeles, respectively, due to a number of factors including onerous contractual requirements, institutionalized theft, and lack of\\npublic investment. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChallenges relating to the supply chain for our bikes and scooters could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nThe supply chain for our bikes and scooters exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or shortages and our recent acquisition of PBSC, a\\nproducer and seller of bikes, has increased that exposure. In the event that our supply of bikes and scooters or key components is interrupted or there are significant\\nincreases in prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Changes in business conditions, force majeure, any public\\nhealth crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental or regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control have affected and could continue to affect our\\nsuppliers’ ability to deliver products and our ability to deploy products to the market, or deliver products to third parties, on a timely basis.\\nWe incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing and operations of our network of Light Vehicles and we expect to continue incurring such\\ncosts as we expand our network of Light Vehicles. The prices and availability of bikes and scooters and related products may fluctuate depending on factors beyond our\\ncontrol including market and economic conditions, tariffs, changes to import or export regulations and demand. Substantial increases in prices of these assets or the cost\\nof our operations would increase our costs and reduce our margins, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further,\\ncustoms authorities may challenge or disagree with our classification, valuation or country of origin determinations of our imports. Such challenges could result in tariff\\nliabilities, including tariffs on past imports, as well as penalties and interest. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible tariff liabilities in our\\nfinancial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.\\nOur bikes and scooters or components thereof, including bikes and scooters and components that we design and contract to manufacture using third-party\\nsuppliers, have experienced and may in the future experience quality problems, product issues or acts of vandalism or theft from time to time, which could result in\\ndecreased usage of our network of Light Vehicles or loss of our bikes or scooters. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all product issues,\\nvandalism or theft of our Light Vehicles. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, litigation or regulatory challenges, including personal injury or products liability\\nclaims, and harm to our reputation.\\nIf we are unable to efficiently develop, enable, or implement partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platforms in a\\ntimely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe partner with several companies to develop autonomous vehicle technology and offerings. Autonomous driving is a new and evolving market, which makes\\nit difficult to predict its acceptance, its growth, and the magnitude and timing of necessary investments and other trends, including when it may be more broadly or\\ncommercially available. Our initiatives may not perform as\\n25\\nexpected, which would reduce the return on our investments in this area and our partners may decide to terminate or scale back their partnerships with us. For example,\\nin October 2022, one of our autonomous vehicle partners announced its wind-down, and as a result we incurred a total impairment charge of $135.7 million consisting\\nof impairments of our non-marketable equity investment in such company and other assets. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic did, and may in the future, delay or\\nprevent us, or our current or prospective partners and suppliers, from being able to develop or deploy autonomous vehicle technology. Following the sale of our Level 5\\nself-driving vehicle division in 2021, we no longer develop our own autonomous vehicle technology, so we must develop and maintain partnerships with other\\ncompanies to offer autonomous vehicle technology on our platforms, and if we are unable to do so, or if we do so at a slower pace or at a higher cost or if our\\ntechnology is less capable relative to our competitors, or if our efforts to optimize our strategy with regard to our autonomous vehicle technology development are not\\nsuccessful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our autonomous vehicle technology partners are delayed\\nor prevented from developing autonomous vehicle technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. For example, a\\ngeneral decrease in available capital, as well as an increase in regulatory scrutiny could delay or prevent the development of autonomous vehicle technology by our\\npartners.\\nThe autonomous vehicle industry may not continue to develop, or autonomous vehicles may not be adopted by the market, which could adversely affect our\\nprospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology for use on our platform. Autonomous driving\\ninvolves a complex set of technologies, including the continued development of sensing, computing and control technology. We have relied on building strategic\\npartnerships with third-party developers of such technologies, as such technologies are costly and in varying stages of maturity. There is no assurance that these\\npartnerships will result in the development of market-viable technologies or commercial success in a timely manner or at all. In order to gain acceptance, the reliability\\nof autonomous vehicle technology must continue to advance.\\nAdditional challenges to the development and deployment of autonomous vehicle technology, all of which are outside of our control, include:\\n•\\nmarket acceptance of autonomous vehicles;\\n•\\nstate, federal or municipal licensing requirements, safety standards, and other regulatory measures;\\n•\\nnecessary changes to infrastructure to enable adoption;\\n•\\nconcerns regarding electronic security and privacy;\\n•\\nlevels of investment by developers of autonomous vehicle technology; and\\n•\\npublic perception regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles for drivers, riders, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road.\\nThere are a number of existing laws, regulations and standards that may apply to autonomous vehicle technology, including vehicle standards that were not\\noriginally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly evolve, which may increase the likelihood of complex,\\nconflicting or otherwise inconsistent regulations, which may delay our ability to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market or significantly increase the\\ncompliance costs associated with this business strategy. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market will accept autonomous vehicles or the timing of such\\nacceptance, if at all, and even if it does, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our offerings will be successful in the market. Even if\\nautonomous vehicle technology is successfully developed and implemented, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent technology and its adopters. In\\nparticular, there could be negative public perception surrounding autonomous vehicles, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries or death occurring as a\\nresult of accidents involving autonomous vehicles and the potential loss of income to human drivers resulting from widespread market adoption of autonomous\\nvehicles. Such negative public perception may result from incidents on our platform, incidents on our partners’ or competitors’ platforms, or events around autonomous\\nvehicles more generally. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nClaims from riders, drivers or third parties that allege harm, whether or not our platform is in use, adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to injuries to, or deaths of, riders, drivers or third-parties that\\nare attributed to us through our offerings. We are also subject to claims alleging that we are directly or vicariously liable for the acts of the drivers on our platform or for\\nharm related to the actions of drivers, riders, or third parties, or the management and safety of our platform and our assets. We are also subject to personal injury claims\\nwhether or not such injury actually occurred as a result of activity on our platform. For example, platform users and third parties have in the past asserted legal claims\\nagainst us in connection with personal injuries related to the actions of a driver or rider who may have previously utilized our platform, but was not at the time of such\\ninjury. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation\\nand to prevent the uncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we face increasing public scrutiny.\\nRegardless of the\\n26\\noutcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any riders, drivers or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation,\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance policies and programs may not provide sufficient coverage to adequately mitigate the potential\\nliability we face, especially where any one incident, or a group of incidents, could cause disproportionate harm, and we may have to pay high premiums or deductibles\\nfor our coverage and, for certain situations and/or categories of claims, we may not be able to secure coverage at all.\\nAs we expand our network of Light Vehicles, we are subject to an increasing number of claims, lawsuits, investigations or other legal proceedings related to\\ninjuries to, or deaths of, riders of our Light Vehicles, including potential indemnification claims. In some cases, we could be required to indemnify governmental\\nentities or operating partners for claims arising out of issues, including issues that may be outside of our control, such as the condition of the public right of way. Any\\nsuch claims arising from the use of our Light Vehicles, regardless of merit or outcome, could lead to negative publicity, harm to our reputation and brand, significant\\nlegal, regulatory or financial exposure or decreased use of our Light Vehicles. Further, the bikes and scooters we design and contract to manufacture using third-party\\nsuppliers and manufacturers, including certain assets and components we design and have manufactured for us, have in the past contained and could in the future\\ncontain design or manufacturing product issues, which could also lead to injuries or death to riders. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix\\nall product issues, and failure to do so could harm our reputation and brand or result in personal injury or products liability claims or regulatory proceedings. Any of the\\nforegoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur bikes and scooters have experienced product issues from time to time, which has in the past resulted in, and, in the future may result in, product recalls and\\nremoval from service, injuries, litigation, enforcement actions and regulatory proceedings, and could adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe design, contract to design and manufacture, sell, and directly and indirectly modify, maintain and repair bikes and scooters for our network of Light\\nVehicles. Such bikes and scooters have in the past contained, and, in the future may contain, product issues related to their design, materials or construction, may be\\nimproperly maintained or repaired or may be subject to vandalism. These product issues, improper maintenance or repair or vandalism have in the past unexpectedly\\ninterfered, and could in the future unexpectedly interfere, with the intended operations of the bikes or scooters, and have resulted, and could in the future result, in other\\nsafety concerns, including alleged injuries to riders or third parties. Although we, our contract manufacturers, and our third-party service providers test our bikes and\\nscooters before they are deployed onto our network or sold, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect or prevent all product issues.\\nFailure to detect, prevent, fix or timely report real or perceived product issues and vandalism, or to properly maintain or repair our bikes and scooters has\\nresulted or may result in a variety of consequences including product recalls and removal from service, service interruptions, alleged injuries, litigation, enforcement\\nactions, including fines or penalties, regulatory proceedings, and negative publicity. Even if injuries to riders or third parties are not the result of any product issues in,\\nvandalism of, or the failure to properly maintain or repair our bikes or scooters, we may incur expenses to defend or settle any claims or respond to regulatory inquiries,\\nand our brand and reputation may be harmed. Any of the foregoing risks could also result in decreased usage of our network of Light Vehicles and adversely affect our\\nbusiness, brand, financial conditions and results of operations.\\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nSince 2012 and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we generally experienced rapid growth in our business, the number of users on our platform and our\\ngeographic reach, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future following the recovery of the world economy. This growth placed, and may continue to\\nplace, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. While employee growth has rapidly occurred at our San Francisco\\nheadquarters and across the United States and internationally, from time to time, we have undertaken restructuring actions to better align our financial model and our\\nbusiness. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, we implemented a plan of termination to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing\\neconomic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, which plan involved the termination of approximately 17% of our\\nemployees. In November 2022, we committed to a plan of termination as part of our efforts to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows, which plan involves the\\ntermination of approximately 13% of our employees. We may need to take additional restructuring actions in the future to align our business with the market. Steps we\\ntake to manage our business operations, including remote work policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies for future growth may adversely\\naffect our reputation and brand, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel.\\nOur ability to manage our growth and business operations effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business\\nwill require us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees. Continued\\ngrowth could strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train\\nand retain highly skilled personnel and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality\\nof our offerings could suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n27\\nAny actual or perceived security or privacy breach or incident could interrupt our operations, harm our brand and adversely affect our reputation, brand, business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of our users’ personal data and other sensitive data. Additionally, we maintain other\\nconfidential, proprietary, or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business, including intellectual property, and similar information we receive from third\\nparties. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or facilities we maintain or use in our business through\\nvarious means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of our service providers, partners or users on our platform, or attempting to\\nfraudulently induce our employees, service providers, partners, users or others into disclosing rider names, passwords, payment card information or other sensitive\\ninformation, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or others into\\nmanipulating payment information, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to criminal actors. In addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their\\nown devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platform, but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches or incidents\\nexperienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks,\\nmaking them difficult to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored or supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them\\neven more difficult to detect.\\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our users’ data and prevent breaches and incidents, these measures cannot\\nguarantee total security or prevent incidents from impacting our platform. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, breaches or\\nincidents, including ransomware or other malware that may result in interruptions to our operations or unavailability of our platform, and third parties may be able to\\naccess our users’ personal information and payment card data that are accessible through those systems. Additionally, as we expand our operations, including licensing\\nor sharing data with third parties, have employees or third-party relationships in jurisdictions outside the United States, or expand work-from-home practices of our\\nemployees, our exposure to cyberattacks, breaches and incidents may increase. As a result of the war in Ukraine, there may be a heightened risk of potential\\ncyberattacks by state actors or others. Further, employee and service provider error, malfeasance or other vulnerabilities, bugs or errors in the storage, use or\\ntransmission of personal information could result in an actual or perceived breach or incident. In the past, there have been allegations regarding violations of our\\npolicies restricting access to personal information we store, and we may be subject to these types of allegations in the future. Our service providers also face various\\nsecurity threats, and we and our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, respond to, or mitigate\\ncyberattacks or security breaches or incidents, and we or they may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to cyberattacks, breaches and incidents.\\nAny actual or perceived breach or incident affecting us or other parties with which we share data or processing data on our behalf could interrupt our\\noperations, result in our platform being unavailable or otherwise disrupted, result in loss, alteration, unavailability or improper use or disclosure of data, result in\\nfraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships with third-party partners, result in regulatory investigations and other\\nproceedings, private claims, demands, litigation and other proceedings, loss of our ability to accept credit or debit card payments, increased card processing fees, and\\nother significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of driver or rider confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any actual or perceived breach or incident impacting autonomous vehicles,\\nwhether through our platform or our competitors’, could result in legal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of rider confidence in our platform, which\\ncould significantly undermine our business. Further, any cyberattacks directed toward, or breaches or incidents impacting, our competitors could reduce confidence in\\nthe ridesharing industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce confidence in us.\\nWe incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents and we expect our costs will increase as we\\ncontinue to implement systems and processes designed to prevent and otherwise address security breaches and incidents. In the event of a future breach or incident, we\\ncould be required to expend additional significant capital and other resources in an effort to respond to or prevent further breaches or incidents, which may require us to\\ndivert substantial resources. Moreover, we could be required or otherwise find it appropriate to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to, notify third\\nparties of, and otherwise address the breach or incident and its root cause.\\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any actual or perceived privacy or security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, could be\\ncostly and divert management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for such liabilities, that insurance will continue to be\\navailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more\\nlarge claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition\\nof large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n28\\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our offerings to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web\\nServices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations using Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do\\nnot have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity\\nattacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We\\nhave experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of\\nfactors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS’ service\\nlevels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success,\\nsustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance,\\nespecially during peak usage times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our\\nreputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our offerings.\\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after\\ncomplying with a one-year advance notice requirement. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to pay amounts\\ndue, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated or we add additional\\ncloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure\\nservice providers. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant\\nshort term loss of revenue, increase our costs and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nOn February 1, 2022 we entered into an addendum to our commercial agreement with AWS, pursuant to which we committed to spend an aggregate of at least\\n$350\\xa0million between February 2022 and January 2026 on AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80\\xa0million in each of the four years. If we fail to meet the\\nminimum purchase commitment during any year, we may be required to pay the difference, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nWe rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners for our Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals program, as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet\\nmanagement and finance partners to support our Express Drive program, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such parties and other risks related to\\nour Express Drive and Lyft Rentals program, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners to supply vehicles to\\ndrivers for our Express Drive program. If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners terminates\\nits relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, the availability of vehicles for drivers in certain markets could be\\nadversely impacted, and we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame.\\nSimilarly, in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a result of\\npublic health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting vehicles in these partners’ fleets, the supply of vehicles available from these partners could become\\nconstrained. In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected its ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program. If we\\ncannot find alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners’ fleets are impacted by events such as vehicle recalls, we may not\\nbe able to meet the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers and consumers. In addition,\\ndue to a number of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-related insurance program, we incur an incrementally higher\\ninsurance cost from our Express Drive program compared to the corresponding cost from the rest of our ridesharing marketplace offerings. If Flexdrive, Lyft’s\\nindependently managed subsidiary, is unable to manage costs of operating Flexdrive’s fleet and potential shortfalls between such costs and the rental fees collected from\\ndrivers, Lyft and Flexdrive may update the pricing methodologies related to Flexdrive’s offering in Lyft’s Express Drive program which could increase prices, and in\\nturn adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers through the Express Drive program.\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners, including publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns,\\ncould adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely\\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur Express Drive program and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.\\nFor the Express Drive vehicle rental program for drivers operated by our independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, a portion of the fleet is sourced from a\\nrange of auto manufacturers. In addition, we have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that\\nmay limit the range of auto manufacturers or vehicles that Flexdrive sources from or purchase. To the extent that any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail\\nproduction, increase the\\n29\\ncost of purchasing cars or decline to provide cars to Flexdrive on terms or at prices consistent with past agreements, despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market\\nand other efforts to mitigate, Flexdrive may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles for Lyft to operate the Express Drive business without significantly\\nincreasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, make operating\\nrental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or Flexdrive’s ability to make vehicles available for rent through the Express\\nDrive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.\\nFlexdrive continues to experience production and delivery delays with new vehicle inventory which hinders its ability to meet current demand and grow the\\nfleet. New vehicle production delays also lead to holding onto existing vehicles longer which in turn leads to increased costs relating to those vehicles. We expect these\\nissues to continue through at least the end of the first quarter of 2023.\\nThe costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. Flexdrive currently sells vehicles through\\nauctions, third-party resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices. It may be difficult to\\nestimate the residual value of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through our Express Drive program. If Flexdrive is unable to obtain and\\nmaintain the fleet of vehicles cost-efficiently or if Flexdrive is unable to accurately forecast the residual values of vehicles in the fleet, our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform, and if we cannot manage our\\nrelationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform. If any of\\nour third-party payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to\\nfind an alternate payment processor, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software\\nand services provided by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised or experience outages.\\nAny of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to drivers on our platform, any\\nof which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to users and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders.\\nNearly all rider payments and driver payouts are made by credit card, debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain payment\\nnetwork or service provider operating rules, to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to riders that may be subject\\nto additional operating rules, regulations and risks. We may also be subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we accept from riders,\\nincluding with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy, data protection and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and\\nregulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card\\ntransactions, which could make our offerings less convenient and attractive to riders. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results\\nof operations could be adversely affected.\\nFor example, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable regulation, we could be subject to certain laws, rules and regulations\\nenforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and numerous state and local agencies who may define money transmitter differently. For\\nexample, certain states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we could be subject to\\nadditional laws, rules and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations and\\nregulators governing our business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we are not\\nin compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal, state or local regulators, including state\\nAttorneys General, as well as those levied by foreign regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include\\ncriminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or\\ncompliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\\nFor various payment options, we are required to pay fees such as interchange and processing fees that are imposed by payment processors, payment networks\\nand financial institutions. These fees are subject to increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, our\\npayment processors require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks and which include,\\namong other obligations, requirements to comply with security standards. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret\\nexisting rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain offerings to some users, be costly to implement or difficult to follow, and if we fail or are alleged to\\nfail to comply with applicable rules or requirements of payment card networks, we may be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept\\nonline payments or other payment card transactions. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors for fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we\\nor the\\n30\\nusers on our platform violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe rely on other third-party service providers and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase\\nand our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur success depends in part on our relationships with other third-party service providers. For example, we rely on third-party encryption and authentication\\ntechnologies licensed from third parties that are designed to securely transmit personal information provided by drivers and riders on our platform. Further, from time to\\ntime, we enter into strategic commercial partnerships in connection with the development of new technology, the growth of our qualified driver base, the provision of\\nnew or enhanced offerings for users on our platform and our expansion into new markets. For example, our roadside assistance offering, our vehicle services offering,\\nand our parking offering are all dependent on third-party service provider partners. If any of our partners terminates its relationship with us, or refuses to renew its\\nagreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such\\nproviders in an acceptable time frame. Similarly, in the event that our strategic partners experience a disruption in their operations, our ability to continue providing\\ncertain product offerings could become constrained. If we cannot find alternate partners, we may not be able to meet the demand for these product offerings, and as a\\nresult, these offerings and our platform may become less attractive. We also rely on other software and services supplied by third parties, such as communications and\\ninternal software, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such software and services do not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are\\ncompromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further,\\nany negative publicity related to any of our third-party partners, including any publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns, could adversely affect our\\nreputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, in certain cases, we rely on these third-party partners to\\nprovide certain data that is important to the management of our business. Errors in the data, or failure to provide data in a timely manner, could adversely affect our\\nability to manage our business and could impact the accuracy of our financial reporting.\\nWe incorporate technology from third parties into our platform, products, and services. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the\\nintellectual property rights of others or that the suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the technology in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Some of our\\nlicense agreements may be terminated by our licensors for convenience. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual\\nproperty infringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter\\ninto new agreements on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop our platform or products containing that technology or provide services using that\\ntechnology could be severely limited and our business could be harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology from third parties, we may be\\nforced to acquire or develop alternate technology, which may require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards and may subject\\nus to certain risks discussed in the preceding paragraph that are currently borne by third parties. This would limit and delay our ability to provide new or competitive\\nofferings and increase our costs. If alternate technology cannot be obtained or developed or if we are unable to develop such alternate technology at commercially\\nreasonable levels of risk, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nIf we are not able to successfully develop new offerings on our platform and enhance our existing offerings, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nOur ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and increase utilization of our offerings will\\ndepend in part on our ability to successfully create and introduce new offerings and to improve upon and enhance our existing offerings. As a result, we may introduce\\nsignificant changes to our existing offerings or develop and introduce new and unproven offerings. If these new or enhanced offerings are unsuccessful, including as a\\nresult of any inability to obtain and maintain required permits or authorizations or other regulatory constraints or because they fail to generate sufficient return on our\\ninvestments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, new driver or rider demands regarding service or\\nplatform features, the availability of superior competitive offerings or a deterioration in the quality of our offerings or our ability to bring new or enhanced offerings to\\nmarket quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the attractiveness of our platform and the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to\\nand additional investments in our offerings or our business model. In addition, we frequently experiment with and test different offerings and marketing strategies. If\\nthese experiments and tests are unsuccessful, or if the offerings and strategies we introduce based on the results of such experiments and tests do not perform as\\nexpected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and maintain or increase utilization of our\\nofferings may be adversely affected.\\nDeveloping and launching new offerings or enhancements to the existing offerings on our platform involves significant risks and uncertainties, including risks\\nrelated to the reception of such offerings by existing and potential future drivers and riders, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated delays or challenges in\\nimplementing such offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of our ability to accurately forecast\\nrider demand and the number of drivers using our platform), our dependence on strategic commercial partnerships, and negative publicity in the event such new or\\nenhanced offerings are perceived to be unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new initiatives have in the\\n31\\npast resulted in, and in the future may result in, operational challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new offerings and enhancements to\\nour existing offerings may involve significant up-front capital investments and such investments may not generate sufficient returns on investment. Further, from time\\nto time we may reevaluate, discontinue and/or reduce these investments and decide to discontinue one or more offerings. For example, in 2020, we began piloting a\\ndelivery service platform that we recently shut down. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers\\nand riders, our ability to increase utilization of our offerings and our visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations. Additionally, since we are focused on building our community and ecosystems for the long-term, our near-term results of operations\\nmay be impacted by our investments in the future.\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our expanding multimodal platform, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nOur expansion, either through our first party offerings or third-party offerings through our partnerships, into bike and scooter sharing, other modes of\\ntransportation, car maintenance services, roadside assistance, parking services, vehicle rental program has increased the complexity of our business. These new\\nofferings have required us to develop new expertise and marketing and operational strategies, and have subjected us to new laws, regulations and risks. For example,\\nwe face the risk that our network of Light Vehicles, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party public transit data into the Lyft App, and other future\\ntransportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering. Additionally, from time to time we may reevaluate our offerings on our multimodal platform\\nand decide to discontinue an offering or certain features. Such actions may negatively impact revenue in the short term and may not provide the benefits we expect in\\nthe long term. If we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our expanding multimodal platform, including the effects our new and evolving\\nofferings have on our existing business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur metrics and estimates, including the key metrics included in this report, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies\\nin those metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nWe regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics used to evaluate our growth, measure our performance and make strategic\\ndecisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been evaluated by a third-party. Our metrics may differ from estimates published by\\nthird parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or the assumptions on which we rely, and we may make material\\nadjustments to our processes for calculating our metrics in order to enhance accuracy, reflect newly available information, address errors in our methodologies, or other\\nreasons, which may result in changes to our metrics. The estimates and forecasts we disclose relating to the size and expected growth of our addressable market may\\nprove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth we have forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates,\\nif at all. Further, as our business develops, we may introduce, revise or cease reporting certain metrics if we determine that such metrics need adjusting to accurately or\\nappropriately measure our performance, no longer represent an effective way to evaluate our business, or if we change how we manage our business such that new\\nmetrics are appropriate. If investors or analysts do not consider our metrics to be accurate representations of our business or compare our metrics to third party\\nestimates or similarly titled metrics of our competitors or others in our industry that are not calculated on the same basis, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our\\nmetrics, then the trading price of our Class A common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nAny failure to offer high-quality user support may harm our relationships with users and could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition\\nand results of operations.\\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders is dependent in part on the ease and reliability of our offerings, including our ability to provide\\nhigh-quality support, including both in-person and remote support. Users on our platform depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our\\nofferings, such as being overcharged for a ride, leaving something in a driver’s vehicle or reporting a safety incident. Our ability to provide effective and timely support\\nis largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain service providers who are qualified to support users and sufficiently knowledgeable regarding our offerings. As\\nwe continue to grow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing quality support services at scale. If we grow our international\\nrider base and the number of international drivers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering\\nsupport in languages other than English. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to provide effective and timely support, including as a result of\\na decrease in the availability of service providers and increase in response time. Any failure to provide efficient and effective user support, or a market perception that\\nwe do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business.\\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, claims of\\nunauthorized payments by a rider, attempted payments by riders with insufficient funds, fraud committed by drivers and fraud committed by riders in concert with\\ndrivers. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person’s\\nidentity, account information or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information and mobile phone\\n32\\nnumbers and accounts. Under current card payment practices, we may be liable for rides facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the\\nassociated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures that we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other\\nmalicious activity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our inability to adequately\\ndetect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or regulatory action and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe have also incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from fraud and other misuse of our platform by drivers and riders, including in connection with\\nprograms we put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides\\nfulfilled and miles traveled in connection with our Concierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased\\ncontrols, platform solutions or other means, our partner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to effectively match riders on our Shared Rides offering and manage the related pricing methodologies, or if we fail to effectively balance driver supply\\nand rider demand on our Wait & Save offering, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nShared Rides enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to benefit from a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer travel times. With a Shared\\nRide, when the first rider requests a ride, our algorithms use the first rider’s destination and attempt to match them with other riders traveling along a similar route. If a\\nmatch between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route. For Shared Rides, drivers earn\\na fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride and the level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the\\npredicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able to match additional riders along the given route, and such fare is\\nquoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from the payment made to the driver as we do not adjust the driver\\npayment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to our Shared Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that\\ndrivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared Rides riders, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\nIf we fail to efficiently balance driver supply and rider demand on our Wait & Save offering and manage the related pricing methodologies and logistics, our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Wait & Save enables riders to opt for a longer wait time but pay a lower fare than for\\na Standard ride, while drivers earn the same as they do for a Standard ride. Wait & Save allows for the rider to be matched with the best-located driver and involves\\ninherent challenges in predicting the future location of drivers. Accordingly, if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Wait & Save riders, or with appropriate\\ndrivers, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to effectively manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWith our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform and service fees\\nfrom drivers. Service fees are a set fee per ride. Platform fees are variable fees, based upon the amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted\\nfare, less the amount earned by the driver (which is based on one or both of the following: (a) the actual time and distance for the trip, or (b) an up-front fare), the\\nservice fee, any applicable driver bonuses or incentives, and any pass-through amounts paid to drivers and third parties. For more information on platform fees, see our\\nTerms of Service, including the Driver Addendum. As we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we\\ntake on risks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider is\\nless than the amount we committed to pay a driver. In addition, riders’ price sensitivity varies by geographic location, among other factors, and if we are unable to\\neffectively account for such variability in our up-front prices, our ability to compete effectively in these locations could be adversely affected. We may from time to\\ntime adjust our prices due to these factors, which may harm our results of operations. If we are unable to effectively manage our up-front pricing methodology in\\nconjunction with our existing and future pricing and incentive programs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.\\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy and support for others, has been critical to our success. We face a number of\\nchallenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\\n•\\nfailure to identify, attract, reward and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values and mission;\\n•\\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\\n•\\nour flexible workplace strategies, which enable certain of our employees to work remotely;\\n33\\n•\\nthe inability to achieve adherence to our internal policies and core values, including our diversity, equity and inclusion practices and initiatives;\\n•\\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values;\\n•\\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry;\\n•\\nthe impact of our cost reduction initiatives, including reductions in force and other actions we may take to drive operating efficiencies;\\n•\\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\\n•\\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees or our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\\n•\\nthe provision of employee benefits in a hybrid and remote work environment; and\\n•\\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\\nFrom time to time, we have undertaken workforce reductions in order to better align our operations with our strategic priorities, manage our cost structure or in\\nconnection with acquisitions. For example, in response to the effects of the macroeconomic environment and efforts to reduce operating expenses, in November 2022,\\nwe announced certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs of approximately 13% of our employees, which may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and\\nour ability to attract and retain employees. These actions may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain personnel and maintain our culture. If we are not able to\\nmaintain our culture, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain, motivate or integrate our personnel, our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur success depends in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel\\nand on our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. We may not be successful in\\nattracting and retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs and actions we take in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and global\\neconomic uncertainty on our business may harm our reputation or impact our ability to recruit qualified personnel in the future. For example, in response to the effects\\nof the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic uncertainty on our business, we have undertaken certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs, furloughs, hiring\\nfreezes and salary reductions, including the termination of approximately 13% of our employees announced in November 2022. These actions may adversely affect\\nemployee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees. Also, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our management team, work for us on an\\nat-will basis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our\\nmanagement team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. If we are unable\\nto attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.\\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled personnel, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly\\nskilled personnel. This competition has intensified in recent periods, and could continue to intensify for such personnel. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to\\noffer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel often consider the value\\nof the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. The decline in our stock price and our cost reduction initiatives may adversely affect our ability\\nto attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition or we may need to provide additional cash or equity compensation to retain\\nemployees. Certain of our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our employees have received and\\nmay continue to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need\\nto invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train and integrate\\nsuch employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our\\nefficiency, ability to meet forecasts and employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users and unfavorable changes in or our failure to comply\\nwith existing or future laws governing the Internet and mobile devices.\\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device and the Internet. We may operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet\\nconnectivity, particularly as we expand internationally. Internet access and access to a mobile device are frequently provided by companies with significant market\\npower that could take actions that degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of users’ ability to access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users\\nof our platform rely on in any particular\\n34\\ngeographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device accessibility, even for a short period of time, could\\nadversely affect our results of operations.\\nMoreover, we are subject to a number of laws and regulations specifically governing the Internet and mobile devices that are constantly evolving. Existing and\\nfuture laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth and availability of the Internet and online offerings, require us to change our business practices\\nor raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover taxation, privacy and data protection,\\ninformation security, pricing, copyrights, distribution, mobile and other communications, advertising practices, consumer protections, web and app accessibility,\\nantitrust and competition, the provision of online payment services, unencumbered Internet access to our offerings and the characteristics and quality of online\\nofferings, among other things. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and\\nbrand, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our apps available to the drivers and riders on our platform, and if we do not effectively\\noperate with or receive favorable placements within such application marketplaces and maintain high rider reviews, our usage or brand recognition could decline\\nand our business, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application marketplaces to make our apps available to the\\ndrivers and riders on our platform. Any changes in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our apps or give preferential treatment to\\nour competitors’ apps could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile devices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us\\nfrom making our apps available to drivers and riders, make changes that degrade the functionality of our apps, increase the cost of using our apps, impose terms of use\\nunsatisfactory to us or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’\\napplication marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our apps, overall growth in our rider or driver base could slow. Our apps have experienced\\nfluctuations in number of downloads in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to support our platform or effectively\\nroll out updates to our apps. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need to ensure that our offerings are designed to work effectively with a range of\\nmobile technologies, systems, networks and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry\\nthat enhance drivers’ and riders’ experience. If drivers or riders on our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our apps on their mobile devices or if we are\\nunable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not control.\\nWe have integrations with a variety of productivity, collaboration, travel, data management and security vendors. As our offerings expand and evolve,\\nincluding to the extent we continue to develop autonomous technology, we may have an increasing number of integrations with other third-party applications, products\\nand services. Third-party applications, products and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its\\ncompatibility with third-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or technology partners may take actions which disrupt the\\ninteroperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we operate and\\ndistribute our platform. As our respective products evolve, we expect the types and levels of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors or technology\\npartners modify their products, standards or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us\\nor gives preferential treatment to competitive products or services, our products, platform, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\nDefects, errors or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems or other technology systems and those of third-party technology providers, or system failures\\nand resulting interruptions in our availability or the availability of other systems and providers, could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the\\ncode has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment,” which refers to the frequent release of our software\\ncode, sometimes multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying our platform. The\\nthird-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerability. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue and access or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could\\nalso be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or incident. We may need to\\nexpend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any\\nfailure to timely and\\n35\\neffectively resolve any such errors, defects or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as negatively\\nimpact our reputation or brand.\\nFurther, our systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software\\ndefects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses,\\ndisruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware or other events. Our systems\\nalso may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, theft and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and\\nour disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may\\nresult from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or\\nreduce or affect the speed or functionality of our offerings. These events have resulted in, and similar future events could result in, losses of revenue. A prolonged\\ninterruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our offerings could adversely affect our business and reputation and could\\nresult in the loss of users. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in harm or losses to the users using our platform, we may make\\nvoluntary payments to compensate for such harm or the affected users could seek monetary recourse or contractual remedies from us for their losses and such claims,\\neven if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.\\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could\\nrestrict our ability to provide our offerings.\\nOur platform and offerings contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and distribution of open source\\nsoftware may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or\\nother contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others\\nto compromise our platform and offerings.\\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of\\nopen source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner,\\nwe could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to\\ncreate similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the public\\nrelease of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\\nAlthough we have policies and processes for using open source software to avoid subjecting our platform and offerings to conditions we do not intend, the\\nterms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could\\nimpose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform and offerings. From time to time, there have been claims challenging\\nthe ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by\\nparties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source\\nsoftware in our platform will be effective. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license,\\nwe could face infringement or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not\\neconomically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis\\nor to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nOur presence outside the United States and our international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\\nSince 2017, we have provided and expanded our offerings in international markets. In addition, we have several international offices that support our business.\\nWe also transact internationally to source and manufacture bikes and scooters and may increase our business in international regions in the future. Operating outside of\\nthe United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs, in\\naddition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering and operations teams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be\\nsuccessful in our international expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\\n•\\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;\\n•\\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively and may enjoy greater local affinity or\\nawareness;\\n36\\n•\\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our offerings less successful;\\n•\\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses;\\n•\\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, tax, trade compliance and local\\nregulatory restrictions and disclosure requirements;\\n•\\nineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries or theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and\\nother confidential business information;\\n•\\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses or other authorizations;\\n•\\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\\n•\\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\\n•\\npolitical, economic, or social instability, which has caused disruptions in certain of our office locations, including in Belarus and Ukraine as a result of the war;\\n•\\ntax policies, treaties or laws that could have an unfavorable business impact; and\\n•\\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be\\nsuccessful, which may result in shutting down international operations or closing international offices. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our\\noperations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIn addition, international expansion has increased our risks in complying with laws and standards in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including with respect to\\ncustoms, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls and trade and economic sanctions. Continued international expansion, including possible engagement with\\nforeign government entities and organizations as customers for our Light Vehicle offerings, including bike-share products through PBSC, may further increase such\\ncompliance risks. We cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held\\nresponsible. In particular, any violation of applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, sanctions and similar laws could result in adverse media coverage,\\ninvestigations, significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil penalties or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, and/or\\nsubstantial diversion of management’s attention, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, public\\ncompanies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations,\\nproduct liability, defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, marketing, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, securities,\\nconsumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions,\\nterms of service, web and mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency\\nmedical transportation, healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-\\ncorruption, anti-bribery, political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign\\nexchange controls and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to\\nvarying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial\\ndecisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\\nThe ridesharing industry, Light Vehicle sharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a peer-to-\\npeer ridesharing marketplace in 2012, the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that were in existence at\\nthat time, and some that have since been adopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or\\notherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharing marketplace. We have been proactively working with federal, state and local governments and regulatory bodies to\\nensure that our ridesharing marketplace and other offerings are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part due to our efforts, a large majority of U.S.\\nstates have adopted laws related to TNCs to address the unique issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and\\nregulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted in response to\\n37\\nour industry and related technologies. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may\\nclaim that we or users on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or that\\nusers on our platform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities,\\nincluding airports, require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting and other compliance requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and\\nscooter sharing, auto repair and collision services, Flexdrive, and autonomous vehicle offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our\\napplications for permits, revoke existing or deny renewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose\\nfines and penalties, including as a result of errors in, or failures to comply with, reporting or other requirements related to our product offerings. Any of the foregoing\\nactions by these jurisdictions and governmental entities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nRecent financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and\\ncompanies engaged in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new\\nregulations that are adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in the market or otherwise,\\nthey may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. See the risk factor entitled\\n“Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.” Such\\nregulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another, and may have a negative outcome that could adversely\\naffect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we have invested and from time to time we will continue to invest resources\\nin an attempt to influence or challenge legislation and other regulatory matters pertinent to our operations, particularly those related to the ridesharing industry, which\\nmay negatively impact the legal and administrative proceedings challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors if we are\\nunsuccessful or lead to additional costs and expenses even if we are successful. These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely\\naffect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur industry is increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipal regulatory authorities across the United\\nStates and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing, and different jurisdictions adopted rules governing\\nminimum driver earnings for ridesharing platforms. For instance, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission adopted rules in 2018, the City of Seattle adopted\\nthe Transportation Network Company Driver Minimum Compensation Ordinance effective January 1, 2021, and, effective January 1, 2023, a statewide Washington\\nlaw, HB 2076, preempts the Seattle Ordinance, but still implements minimum driver earnings standards. Other jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may want\\nto operate have and could continue to consider similar legislation. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operations\\ninternationally, particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on or\\nmaterial limitations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model negatively\\nto raise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may continue to take\\nactions and employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to\\nchange such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.\\nAny of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChallenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory\\nproceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a\\ndriver is an independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and\\nmisclassification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities which can create uncertainty and unpredictability\\nfor us. For more information regarding the litigation in which we have been involved, see the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 9. Commitments and\\nContingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 3, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, in 2021, the U.S. Secretary of Labor\\nexpressed his view that in some cases “gig workers should be classified as employees” and that further review was ongoing. In October 2022, the United States\\nDepartment of Labor released a proposed rule regarding the classification of employees and independent contractors under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act\\n(FLSA). The proposed rule would implement new interpretative guidance for classification of workers. The Department of Labor is currently reviewing comments and\\nthe rule has not been finalized. We continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in such legal and administrative proceedings and\\nintend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters, but our arguments may ultimately be unsuccessful. A determination in, or settlement of, any legal\\nproceeding, whether we are\\n38\\nparty to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, could harm our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations, including as a result of:\\n•\\nmonetary exposure arising from or relating to failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and hour laws and requirements (such as those\\npertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide required breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive\\ndamages, penalties, including related to the California Private Attorneys General Act, and government fines;\\n•\\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\\n•\\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation and unemployment;\\n•\\nclaims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation under civil rights laws;\\n•\\nclaims under new or existing laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining and other concerted activity;\\n•\\nother claims, charges or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees, including risks relating to allegations of joint\\nemployer liability or agency liability; and\\n•\\nharm to our reputation and brand.\\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an\\nemployee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and/or operations (including suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions),\\nincrease our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\\nWe have been involved in numerous legal proceedings related to driver classification. We are currently involved in several putative class actions, several\\nrepresentative actions brought, for example, pursuant to California’s Private Attorney General Act, several multi-plaintiff actions and thousands of individual claims,\\nincluding those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as\\nindependent contractors. We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York,\\nPennsylvania, and New Jersey. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\\nClaims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\\nCompanies in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual\\nproperty rights. In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or\\notherwise obtained. As our business continues to evolve, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public\\nprofile, increases in the number of competitors in our markets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new intellectual\\nproperty, as well as potential international expansion. In addition, various products and services of ours host, integrate, or otherwise rely on third party content or\\nintellectual property, including our Lyft Media efforts, which provide third party promotional advertisements, and our marketing and brand journalism efforts. From\\ntime to time third parties may assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled “Legal\\nProceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of\\nintellectual property infringement and, in some instances, have sought to initiate licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there\\ncan be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and\\nothers may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face,\\nlitigation involving patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may\\ntherefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding companies, have the ability to\\ndedicate substantial resources to assert their intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur\\nsubstantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property.\\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential\\ninformation during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment\\nagainst us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us from using or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement\\nthat prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which\\nmay not be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and\\ntherefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable\\nterms, or at all, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require significant time (during which\\nwe\\n39\\nwould be unable to continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other forms of\\ninformation, knowhow and technology), or “intellectual property,” and as we grow, we expect to continue to develop intellectual property that is important for our\\nexisting or future business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to\\nestablish and protect our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and may vary by\\njurisdiction. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could\\nbe time-consuming and expensive and could divert management attention. While we take precautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be\\npossible for competitors and other unauthorized third parties to copy our technology, reverse engineer our data and use our proprietary information to create or enhance\\ncompeting solutions and services, which could adversely affect our position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Some license provisions that\\nprotect against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries.\\nThe laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property as do the laws of the United States and effective intellectual property\\nprotections may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Our domestic and international intellectual property protection and enforcement strategy is\\ninfluenced by many considerations including costs, where we have business operations, where we might have business operations in the future, legal protections\\navailable in a specific jurisdiction, and/or other strategic considerations. As such, we do not have identical or analogous intellectual property protection in all\\njurisdictions, which could risk freedom to operate in certain jurisdictions if we were to expand. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized\\nuse, copying, transfer and disclosure of proprietary information will likely increase. We may need to expend additional resources to protect, enforce or defend our\\nintellectual property rights domestically or internationally, which could impair our business or adversely affect our domestic or international operations. We enter into\\nconfidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with our third-party providers and\\nstrategic partners. We cannot assure you that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, and use and distribution of, our platform and proprietary\\ninformation. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our\\nofferings. Competitors and other third parties may also attempt to access, aggregate, and/or reverse engineer our data which would compromise our trade secrets and\\nother rights. We also enter into strategic partnerships, joint development and other similar agreements with third parties where intellectual property arising from such\\npartnerships may be jointly-owned or may be transferred or licensed to the counterparty. Such arrangements may limit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or\\ncommercialize such intellectual property rights, including requiring agreement with or payment to our joint development partners before protecting, maintaining,\\nlicensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectual property rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such\\nintellectual property rights in a manner that may affect the value of the jointly-owned intellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.\\nWe may be required to spend significant resources in order to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and some violations may be difficult or\\nimpossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in\\nthe impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and\\ncountersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology\\nagainst unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our\\nplatform, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or harm our reputation or\\nbrand. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings or platform features, which may not be\\non commercially reasonable terms or at all and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\\nOur industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, particularly regarding autonomous vehicle technology, including by foreign actors.\\nWe, along with others in our industry, have been the target of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future. Although\\nwe take measures to protect our property, if we are unable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments may be\\nundermined and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply\\nwith such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could adversely affect our\\nbusiness.\\nWe receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other data relating to users on our platform, as well as other individuals such as our\\nemployees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use,\\ndisclosure and protection of certain data, including the\\n40\\nCalifornia Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography\\nand Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and\\nAccountability Act of 1996, as amended by the HITECH Act, or HIPAA, Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or\\nCCPA, and the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which became operative as of January 1, 2023. The scope of data protection laws may continually change,\\nthrough new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the\\nCPRA require new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information.\\nThe CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcement\\nremain unclear. Additionally, other states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, have enacted laws that have gone or will go into effect in 2023 and are\\nsimilar to the CCPA and CPRA. The U.S. federal government and other states are also contemplating federal and state privacy legislation. These new and modified\\nlaws, including the CPRA, and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified laws\\nor regulations that require enhanced protection of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of\\nproviding our offerings, require significant changes to our operations and our data processing practices and policies, may require us to incur additional compliance-\\nrelated costs and expenses, and may even prevent us from providing certain offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in the\\nfuture.\\nFurther, as we continue to expand our offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional privacy-related laws and regulations. For example, in\\nconnection with the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division to Woven Planet, we have entered into certain data sharing and other agreements with Woven\\nPlanet to facilitate and accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology. In addition, our Lyft Media efforts provide third party promotional\\nadvertisements, including those that may be personalized to users. Changes in the law or regulatory landscape could limit or prohibit activities in regard to any new\\nofferings we undertake. Further, the collection and storage of data in connection with the use of our Concierge and Lyft Pass for Healthcare offerings by healthcare\\npartners subjects us to compliance requirements under HIPAA. HIPAA and its implementing regulations contain requirements on covered entities and business\\nassociates regarding the use, collection, security, storage and disclosure of individuals’ protected health information, or PHI. Contracted healthcare entities including\\nhealthcare providers, health plans, and transportation managers using our Concierge or Lyft Pass for Healthcare offerings are either covered entities or business\\nassociates under HIPAA. We must also comply with HIPAA as we use and disclose the PHI of riders in our capacity as a business associate of other contracted\\nhealthcare covered entities or other contracted business associates of a healthcare covered entity. Compliance obligations under HIPAA include privacy, security and\\nbreach notification obligations and could subject us to increased liability for any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI determined to be a “breach.” If we knowingly\\nbreach the HITECH Act’s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to civil penalties that range\\nfrom $100 - $50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum per violation calendar year cap of $1.5 million for “willful neglect” violations and the possibility of civil\\nlitigation.\\nAdditionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information\\nsecurity standards imposed by law, regulation, or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRA imposing new and\\nrelatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we may face\\nchallenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do\\nso. In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our healthcare customers under our agreements with them. As\\nwe consider expansion of business offerings and markets and as laws and regulations change, we expect to incur additional costs related to privacy, data protection and\\ninformation security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or contractual obligations related to such offerings and face additional\\nrisks that such expansion could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of such laws, regulations or obligations.\\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible\\nthat our practices, offerings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our\\nfailure, or the failure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws, regulations or other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or\\ninformation security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal information or other driver or rider data, or the\\nperception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing drivers and riders from\\nusing our platform or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the perception of concerns relating to privacy, data protection or information security, whether or not valid,\\nmay harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n41\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary\\ncourse of business, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker classification, driver earnings, labor and employment, anti-discrimination,\\ncommercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints, intellectual property disputes, compliance with regulatory requirements, securities laws, and other matters,\\nand we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations and legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we\\ndeploy new offerings such as autonomous vehicle technology, Lyft Car Maintenance and our network of Light Vehicles and deliveries, including proceedings related to\\nproduct liability or our acquisitions, securities issuances or business practices. We are also regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government\\ninvestigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings seeking to hold us liable for the actions of independent contractor drivers on our platform. See the section\\ntitled “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations or other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with\\ncertainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\\nmanagement attention and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant\\nsubjective judgment and speculation. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and\\npenalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These proceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and brand,\\nsanctions, consent decrees, injunctions or other orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal\\nexpenses on behalf of our business, commercial, and government partners and current and former directors and officers.\\nA determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that involves our industry, could harm our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a determination that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, whether we are\\nparty to such determination or not, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.\\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders on our platform. These provisions are intended to\\nstreamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court.\\nHowever, arbitration may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may\\nsubject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our\\nreputation and brand, we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of\\nwhich could increase our litigation costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and\\nemployees.\\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and\\nfederal law, there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of\\nprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could\\nexperience an increase in our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs we expand our offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and\\nregulations or manage the increased costs associated with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nAs we continue to expand our offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from one\\njurisdiction to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate\\nor address the unique issues faced by our industry.\\nFor example, contracting with healthcare entities and transportation managers representing healthcare entities may subject us to certain healthcare related laws\\nand regulations. These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on us and our platform in providing access to rides through the Lyft Platform on behalf\\nof healthcare partners. Additional requirements may arise related to the collection and storage of data and systems infrastructure design, all of which could increase the\\ncosts associated with our offerings to healthcare partners. With respect to our healthcare rides matched through the Lyft Platform and provided to Medicaid or Medicare\\nAdvantage beneficiaries, we are subject to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws that impose penalties for violations. Significant violations of such laws could lead to\\nour loss of Medicaid provider enrollment status and could also potentially result in exclusion from the federal and state healthcare programs as an authorized\\ntransportation platform provider. Further, we may in certain circumstances be or become considered a government contractor with respect to certain of our services,\\nwhich would expose us to\\n42\\ncertain risks such as the government’s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector’s budgetary cycles and funding authorization, and the government’s\\nadministrative and investigatory processes.\\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to our offerings, it is possible that our practices, offerings or\\nplatform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-\\nparty providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to our offerings, could harm our reputation and brand,\\ndiscourage new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform, lead to refunds of ride fares or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies or\\nprivate claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to federal and state\\nconsumer protection laws governing telemarketing, including SMS text messaging. For example, the TCPA regulates and restricts certain telemarketing and automated\\nSMS text messaging (both marketing and non-marketing) without proper consent. This has resulted and may in the future result in civil claims against us and/or\\nregulatory enforcement by federal and state agencies. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are\\ncontinuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct\\nliability and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial\\nstatements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the\\nlisting standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and\\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that\\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\\nspecified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal\\nexecutive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue\\nto expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial\\nreporting.\\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including increased\\ncomplexity resulting from any international expansion, the expanded work-from-home practices of our employees and flexible work arrangements, new offerings on\\nour platform or from strategic transactions, including acquisitions and divestitures. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial\\nreporting have been discovered in the past, and other weaknesses may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any\\ndifficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\\nresult in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also\\nadversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness\\nof our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\\nover financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market\\nprice of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global\\nSelect Market.\\nOur independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control\\nover financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could\\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\\nChanges in U.S. and foreign tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\\nWe are subject to tax laws, regulations, and policies of the U.S. federal, state, and local governments and of comparable taxing authorities in foreign\\njurisdictions. As various levels of governments and international organizations become increasingly focused on tax reform, changes in tax laws, as well as other factors,\\ncould cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. For\\nexample, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which introduced a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks that could impact us in connection with a\\nsettlement of the capped call transactions. Further, a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development\\nexpenditures in the current year and requires the capitalization and amortization of such costs. Although future legislative updates could defer or eliminate this\\nrequirement, there is no assurance that the provision will be repealed or\\n43\\nmodified. Many countries, and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have proposed implementing changes to existing\\ntax laws, including a proposed global minimum tax of 15%. Any of these or other developments or changes in federal, state, or international tax laws or tax rulings\\ncould adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results.\\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar taxes\\nand may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as payroll tax, sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to\\nbusinesses like ours and to drivers is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before\\nthe adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as a result,\\namounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing\\nstatutes might apply to our business or to drivers’ businesses.\\nIn addition, local governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative\\naction to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. For example, it is becoming more common for local governments to impose per trip fees specifically on\\nTNC rides. Such taxes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities have raised and may continue to raise questions about or challenge or\\ndisagree with our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes, and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit\\nadditional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and interest. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in\\njurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax\\nliabilities, including taxes on past transactions, as well as penalties and interest, and could discourage drivers and riders from utilizing our offerings or could otherwise\\nharm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our financial\\nstatements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.\\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping or indirect tax collection\\nobligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to\\ncalculate, collect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related legislation. New legislation may require us or\\ndrivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection, remittance and audit requirements, which could make\\nour offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any\\nsuch difference may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax\\noutcome is determined.\\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our\\nmanagement team have limited experience managing a public company.\\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the\\nreporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,\\nthe rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file\\nannual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal\\nand financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to\\nsubstantial additional costs, distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of\\ndisclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or\\nactual litigation, including by competitors. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified, we may incur additional costs rectifying\\nthose or new issues, and the existence of these issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of it. For example, we have incurred costs related to\\nthe restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and related material weakness as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for our\\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which material weakness was remediated as of June 30, 2022. In addition, it may become more expensive to obtain director and\\nofficer liability insurance due to these issues.\\nCertain members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and\\ncomplying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage being a public\\ncompany subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting\\n44\\nobligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These obligations and constituents require significant\\nattention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\\nWe have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, and requiring our suppliers to ensure\\nthe efficient use of raw materials, water, and energy resources via our Supplier Code of Conduct, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever\\nbusiness is conducted. For example, our San Francisco, California headquarters is projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity and sea level rise due to climate\\nchange, as well as climate-related events including wildfires and associated power shut-offs. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme\\nweather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business\\nof our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging\\nclimate change policies such as California’s Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program, which imposes greenhouse gas and EV requirements on our industry, and\\nfailure to meet the future requirements could have adverse impacts on our costs and ability to operate in California, as well as public goodwill towards our company.\\nMassachusetts and New York City are developing rules to address the environmental impact of rideshare, and other jurisdictions are likely to consider similar rules and\\nregulations in the future. We advocate for EV programs that can be efficiently accessed by drivers on our platform and rental car operators, and any failure of such\\nprograms to address EV capital costs, EV charging costs, and EV charging infrastructure in the context of transportation network companies’ unique needs could\\nchallenge our ability to progress toward our 100% EV commitment. Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant capital investments and\\nrecurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of\\nutilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be\\nadversely affected. We may also enter into arrangements with third parties for financing, leasing or otherwise, to enable us to meet our commitment to 100% EVs on\\nour platform by the end of 2030. Such transactions may require us to provide guarantees for financing. We may also benefit from certain tax credits for EVs and, if such\\ntax credits expire or are terminated or we are otherwise unable to use them, we may not realize the benefits we have planned and our business and financial condition\\nand results of operations may be negatively affected.\\nRisks Related to Financing and Transactional Factors\\nWe may require additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\\nHistorically, we funded our capital-intensive operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our operations.\\nTo support our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our offerings, including potential new offerings. In\\nNovember 2022, we entered into a $420.0 million revolving credit agreement, in May 2020, we issued $747.5\\xa0million in aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes\\nand, from time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, including by the issuance of securities. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of\\nequity, equity-linked or debt securities, such as our 2025 Notes, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our Class A common stock,\\nand our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Further, we have secured debt financing which has resulted in fixed obligations and certain restrictive covenants,\\nand any debt financing secured by us in the future would result in increased fixed obligations and could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-\\nraising activities and other financial and operational matters, as well as liens on some or all of our assets, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional\\ncapital and to pursue business opportunities.\\nWe evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts,\\nbusiness plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Additionally, deteriorating macroeconomic conditions,\\nincluding economic instability or uncertainty, and other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, as well as slowing growth\\nin the worldwide economy, inflation and higher interest rates, have negatively impacted the financing markets, and may impact our access to capital and make\\nadditional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms,\\nor at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business\\ngrowth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do not\\nachieve our objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, new\\ntechnologies, services and other assets, joint ventures and strategic investments that complement our business, such as our acquisition of PBSC in May 2022, as well as\\ndivestitures, partnerships and other transactions. We have previously acquired and invested in, and we continue to seek to acquire and invest in businesses,\\ntechnologies, or other assets that we believe could complement or expand our business, including acquisitions of new lines of business and other opportunities that\\noperate\\n45\\nin relatively nascent markets. As we grow, we also may explore investments in new technologies, which we may develop or other parties may develop. The\\nidentification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential acquisition or strategic investment transactions may divert the attention of management and entail various\\nexpenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and\\nconsummating favorable transaction opportunities.\\nThese transactions involve numerous risks, whether or not completed, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and\\nresults of operations, including:\\n•\\nintense competition for suitable acquisition and investment targets, which could increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals\\non favorable or acceptable terms;\\n•\\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\\n•\\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\\n•\\nour ability to successfully obtain indemnification or representation and warranty insurance;\\n•\\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company;\\n•\\nchallenges related to entering into new markets or geographies;\\n•\\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\\n•\\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\\n•\\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\\n•\\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual\\nproperty, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\\n•\\nacquired businesses or businesses that we invest in may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations,\\nincluding with respect to data privacy, data protection, and data security, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, export controls, sanctions and\\nindustry-specific-regulation;\\n•\\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business, or the risk that we\\nbecome subject to new or additional regulatory burdens that affect our business in potentially unanticipated and significantly negative ways;\\n•\\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\\n•\\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new offerings cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\\n•\\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.\\nIn addition, we may divest businesses or assets or enter into joint ventures, strategic partnerships or other strategic transactions. For example, in February\\n2023, we closed the sale of our vehicle service center business and in July 2021, we closed the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division. In addition, as a result\\nof our acquisition of PBSC, we became an indirect party to certain partnerships and joint ventures that we did not negotiate, and with partners with whom we are less\\nfamiliar. These types of transactions present certain risks; for example, we may not achieve the desired strategic, operational and financial benefits of a divestiture,\\npartnership, joint venture or other strategic transaction, or we may have difficulty operating together with another partner or joint venturer. Further, during the pendency\\nof a divestiture or during the integration or separation process of any strategic transaction, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of\\nemployees, customers, or suppliers.\\nFurther, minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal,\\noperational, regulatory, and/or compliance risks associated with the investment. In addition, we may be dependent on other persons or entities who control the entities\\nin which we invest, including their management or controlling shareholders, and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\\nBusiness decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them may\\nadversely affect the value of our investment or result in litigation or regulatory action against us. We can provide no assurance that our investments in other\\ntechnologies or businesses will generate returns for our business, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For example, in October 2022, one\\nof our autonomous vehicle partners announced its wind-down, and as a result we incurred a total impairment of $135.7 million consisting of impairments of our non-\\nmarketable equity investment in such company and other assets.\\n46\\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services\\nand other assets, strategic investments or other transactions, or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, or if we are unable to successfully\\ncomplete other transactions or such transactions do not meet our strategic objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely\\naffected.\\nServicing our current and future debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our\\nindebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our\\nflexibility in operating our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\\nIn May 2020, we issued our 2025 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Flexdrive,\\nwhich is now a wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party\\nlender, a Master Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender and a Vehicle Procurement Agreement, as amended, with\\na third-party; and, following the acquisition, we continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed under these agreements. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, we had $839.5 million of indebtedness for borrowed money outstanding. In November 2022, we also entered into a revolving credit facility with\\ncertain lenders providing the ability to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $420.0 million, none of which has been drawn as of December 31, 2022. See\\nNote 10 “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements, for further information on these agreements and our outstanding debt obligations.\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest or fees on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance,\\nwhich is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future\\nsufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more\\nalternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability\\nto refinance any existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of\\nthese activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. Events and circumstances may also occur which\\nwould cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may\\ncontain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default\\nwhich, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\\nIn addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For\\nexample, it could:\\n•\\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in\\ngovernment regulation;\\n•\\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\\n•\\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\\n•\\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and\\n•\\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.\\nFurther, as of January 1, 2022, LIBOR settings for all non-U.S. dollar currencies and U.S. dollar one-week and two-month LIBOR settings ceased being\\npublished, provided or representative. InterContinental Benchmark Exchange and the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority have confirmed that LIBOR\\nsettings for all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will cease to be published, provided or representative after June 30, 2023. If new methods of calculating LIBOR are\\nestablished or if other benchmark rates used to price indebtedness or investments are established, the terms of any existing or future indebtedness or investments,\\nincluding the terms of Flexdrive’s debt instruments, may be negatively impacted or require amendment, resulting in increased interest expense or lower than expected\\ninterest income.\\nIn addition, under certain of our and our subsidiary’s existing debt instruments, we and Flexdrive are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants\\nregarding our business and operations, including limitations on Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset\\ndispositions. If we or Flexdrive, as applicable, do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, and do not obtain a waiver or consent\\nfrom the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable. Any debt financing secured by us in the\\nfuture could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements\\ncould require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows\\nand liquidity.\\n47\\nAny of these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to\\nour business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely\\naffect our results of operations.\\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur\\nadditional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases\\nof stock, make investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our current and future\\noperations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more\\ndifficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies which are not subject to such restrictions.\\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the\\nagreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all\\nborrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving credit facility were to be\\naccelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could\\nimmediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on\\ncommercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.\\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\\nIn connection with the issuance of our 2025 Notes, we entered into the capped call transactions, or Capped Calls. The option counterparties are financial\\ninstitutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties\\nwill not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial\\ninstitutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our\\nexposure at that time under the Capped Calls with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will\\nbe correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer\\nadverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial\\nstability or viability of the option counterparties.\\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had $7.8\\xa0billion of federal and $6.7\\xa0billion of state net operating losses (“NOLs”) available to reduce future taxable income,\\nwhich will begin to expire in 2030 for federal purposes and in 2023 for state purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use NOLs\\nbefore their expiration, or at all. Under Section\\xa0 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the\\ncorporation’s ability to use\\xa0its\\xa0pre-change\\xa0NOLs\\xa0to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative\\nchange in our ownership by\\xa0“5-percent\\xa0shareholders”\\xa0that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar limitations may apply under state tax\\nlaws. Our ability to use net operating losses to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes\\nand ownership changes that may occur in the future.\\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, among other things,\\nlimited the use of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December\\xa031, 2017 to 80% of taxable income for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. Not all\\nstates conform to the Tax Act or CARES Act. In future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is recognized related to our NOLs, these changes may significantly\\nimpact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December\\xa031, 2017.\\n48\\nRisks Related to Governance and Ownership of our Capital Stock Factors\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders, which will limit your ability to influence the\\noutcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\\nOur Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued and\\noutstanding shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock. Accordingly, Logan Green, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors holds\\napproximately 20.42% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and President and Vice Chair of our board of directors,\\nholds approximately 12.05% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, will be able to significantly\\ninfluence matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger,\\nconsolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our Co-Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ\\nfrom yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying,\\npreventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a\\nsale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Each Co-Founder’s voting power is as of December\\xa031, 2022 and\\nincludes shares of Class A common stock expected to be issued upon the vesting of such Co-Founder’s RSUs within 60 days of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class\\xa0B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class\\xa0A common stock, subject to\\nlimited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one\\nshare of Class A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\\nstock, (ii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the shares of Class\\xa0B common\\nstock held by our Co-Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of the Class\\xa0B common stock held by our Co-Founders\\nand their permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the\\nlast to die or become disabled of our Co-Founders, or such later date not to exceed a total period of 18 months after such death or disability as may be approved by a\\nmajority of our independent directors.\\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on our stock price.\\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or\\nother adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of\\ntheir indexes. Under such announced policies, our dual class capital structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds,\\nexchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices will not be investing in our stock. Because of our dual class structure,\\nwe will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of\\ninvestment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and\\ncould make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond\\nour control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading\\nprice of our Class A common stock include the following:\\n•\\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including fluctuations due to general economic uncertainty or negative market\\nsentiment, in particular related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n•\\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks generally, or those in our industry, including fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate\\nto the operating performance of those technology companies;\\n•\\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\\n•\\nsales or purchases of shares of our Class A common stock by us, our officers, or our significant stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales or\\npurchases could occur;\\n•\\nissuance of shares of our Class A common stock, whether in connection with our equity incentive plans, an acquisition or upon conversion of some or all of\\nour outstanding 2025 Notes;\\n49\\n•\\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet\\nthese estimates or the expectations of investors;\\n•\\nthe financial projections or goals we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or goals or our failure to meet those projections or goals;\\n•\\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features;\\n•\\ninvestor sentiment and the public’s reaction to our press releases, earnings and other public announcements and filings with the SEC, or those of our\\ncompetitors or others in our industry;\\n•\\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\\n•\\nshort selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;\\n•\\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\\n•\\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\\n•\\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\\n•\\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\\n•\\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;\\n•\\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or statements by public officials regarding potential\\nnew laws or regulations;\\n•\\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\\n•\\nany significant change in our management or our board of directors; and\\n•\\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action\\nlitigation has often been instituted against these companies. For example, as disclosed above, beginning in April 2019, several putative class actions have been filed in\\nCalifornia state and federal courts and derivative actions have been filed in Delaware and California federal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, and\\ncertain of the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in\\nconnection with our IPO. Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them, such matters could result in substantial\\ncosts and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy\\ncontest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.\\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in\\ncontrol by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which\\nthe person became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated\\ncertificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\\n•\\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amendments by stockholders to our amended and restated bylaws require the\\napproval of at least two-thirds of our then-outstanding voting power;\\n•\\nour dual class common stock structure, which provides our Co-Founders, individually or together, with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of\\nmatters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B\\ncommon stock;\\n•\\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for\\ncause;\\n•\\nour stockholders are only able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and are not able to take action by written consent for any matter;\\n50\\n•\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\\n•\\nvacancies on our board of directors are able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\\n•\\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or a majority\\nof our board of directors;\\n•\\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\\n•\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may\\nbe issued without further action by our stockholders; and\\n•\\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could\\nalso discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire,\\nany of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and\\ncould also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes\\nbetween us and our stockholders and also provide that the federal district courts will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause\\nof action arising under the Securities Act, each of which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,\\nofficers or employees.\\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the\\nsole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\\nour directors, stockholders, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation\\nLaw, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal\\naffairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the\\nfederal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and\\nrestated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States are the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action\\narising under the Securities Act against any person in connection with any offering of our securities, including, without limitation and for the avoidance of doubt, any\\nauditor, underwriter, expert, control person or other defendant.\\nAny person or entity purchasing, holding or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these\\nprovisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors,\\nofficers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum\\nprovisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\\nother jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\\nItem 1B.\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments.\\nNone.\\nItem 2.\\xa0Properties.\\nOur corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, and consist of approximately\\xa0309,000 square feet under lease agreements through May 31,\\n2030.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled “Selected\\nConsolidated Financial and Other Data” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal years 2022 and 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of fiscal year 2020\\nand year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\\nCondition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

We also experienced volatility in the overall marketplace health on our platform during\\nthis period, including fluctuations in driver supply and service levels. In 2021, we saw some recovery from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as vaccines were more\\nwidely distributed and more communities fully reopened, which resulted in improved performance compared to 2020. In 2022, while we saw decreased demand in the\\nfirst quarter driven by an increase in cases due to variants of the virus, we saw sequential quarterly improvements in demand and overall marketplace health. In the\\nfourth quarter of 2022, we had the highest numbers of Active Riders in nearly three years. For full-year 2022, we generated revenue of $4.1 billion, the highest since\\nour inception. However, our costs also increased, with the insurance-related increase due to, among other reasons, inflation, the cost of medical care and litigation. In\\nthe fourth quarter of 2022, we strengthened our insurance reserves and accrued and other current liabilities by $375 million to mitigate exposure to these fluctuations.\\nAlthough there has been an improvement in overall demand and our marketplace health, demand for our platform has not returned to pre-pandemic levels in\\nall markets and the timing of demand and supply improvements has not always aligned. Near-term, we expect lower prices - which are the result of strong supply\\ntailwinds and competitive dynamics - will adversely impact our revenue and profitability. However, lower prices can help stimulate demand over time, and with more\\ndemand and better supply - and a healthier marketplace overall - we can build a much larger business. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of the COVID-19\\npandemic or the impact a deteriorating macroeconomic environment on lifestyle trends or consumer behavior, and these factors may harm future growth and profits.\\nFor more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic conditions and competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in\\nItem 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nRecent Developments\\nAcquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc. (“PBSC”)\\nOn May 17, 2022, we completed our acquisition of PBSC, a global leader in bikeshare, which supplies stations and bikes to markets internationally, for a total\\npurchase price of $163.5 million inclusive of $14.1 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The acquisition was treated as a business combination\\nand increases our scale in micromobility by leveraging PBSC’s deep sales experience and customer relationships. Refer to Note 3 “Acquisitions” to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements for information regarding this transaction.\\nCommutation of the Reinsurance Agreement\\nOn June 21, 2022, PVIC and DARAG completed the Commutation Transaction, which effectively commuted and settled the previous Reinsurance Agreement.\\nAs a result of the Commutation Transaction, the Company recognized a $36.8 million gain in cost of revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2022, including\\namortization of a portion of the previously recognized deferred gain. Refer to Note 6 “Supplemental Financial Statement Information - Commutation of the\\nReinsurance Agreement” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction.\\nNovember 2022 Restructuring Activities\\nOn November 3, 2022, we committed to a plan of termination as part of our efforts to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows. The plan involved the\\ntermination of approximately 683 employees, representing 13% of our employees. As a result of the restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded $29.5\\nmillion in employee severance and other employee costs and $9.5 million in net stock-based compensation expense related to equity compensation for employees\\nimpacted by the plan of termination. We have also incurred restructuring charges related to the exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities, which included\\n$55.3\\xa0million in impairment charges related to real estate operating lease right-of-use assets, $23.9 million in accelerated depreciation of certain fixed assets and\\n$2.1\\xa0million in write-off of fixed assets not yet placed into service. As a result of these charges, we incurred net restructuring charges of $120.3 million in the fourth\\nquarter of 2022. We also announced the intention to pursue a sale of certain assets related to our first-party vehicle service business on a blog post dated November 3,\\n2022 available on the Company’s website.\\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we expect to finalize the exit of certain leases as part of the plan of termination and we completed a transaction for the divestiture\\nof certain assets related to our first party vehicle services business to align with our anticipated operating needs. As a result, in the first quarter of 2023, the Company\\nexpects to record lease termination penalties and additional impairment charges related to the cease use of certain facilities to real estate operating lease right-of-use\\nassets. The remaining employee related charges, which include employee severance, benefits and stock-based compensation, will not be material in the first quarter of\\n2023.\\nRefer to Note 16 “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this reduction in workforce.\\n54\\nKey Metrics\\nActive Riders and Revenue per Active Rider\\nThe number of Active Riders is a key indicator of the scale of our community and awareness of our brand. Revenue per Active Rider represents our ability to\\ndrive usage and monetization of our platform.\\nActive Riders\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n2021 to 2022 %\\nChange\\n2020 to 2021 %\\nChange\\n(in thousands, except for dollar amounts and percentages)\\nThree Months Ended March 31\\n17,804\\n13,494\\n21,211\\n31.9%\\n(36.4)%\\nThree Months Ended June 30\\n19,860\\n17,142\\n8,688\\n15.9%\\n97.3%\\nThree Months Ended September 30\\n20,312\\n18,942\\n12,513\\n7.2%\\n51.4%\\nThree Months Ended December 31\\n20,358\\n18,728\\n12,552\\n8.7%\\n49.2%\\nRevenue per Active Rider\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n2021 to 2022 %\\nChange\\n2020 to 2021 %\\nChange\\nThree Months Ended March 31\\n$49.18\\n$45.13\\n$45.06\\n9.0%\\n0.2%\\nThree Months Ended June 30\\n$49.89\\n$44.63\\n$39.06\\n11.8%\\n14.3%\\nThree Months Ended September 30\\n$51.88\\n$45.63\\n$39.94\\n13.7%\\n14.2%\\nThree Months Ended December 31\\n$57.72\\n$51.79\\n$45.40\\n11.5%\\n14.1%\\nWe define Active Riders as all riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active Rider is identified\\nby a unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the\\nquarter, that person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be\\nconsidered a single Active Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the\\ncalculation of Active Riders unless the ride is accessible in the Lyft App. Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for\\nthe same period.\\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account. Accordingly,\\nLyft updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider’s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to access\\ntheir ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020,\\nall Concierge riders were excluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.\\nIn each of the three month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2022, Active Riders and Revenue per Active Rider increased\\ncompared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to improvements to demand on our platform as we continue to recover from the impacts of COVID-19. Active\\nRiders in the three month periods ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 represented significantly lower Active Rider counts as those periods were in earlier stages\\nof the COVID-19 recovery with more limited vaccine access, which had materially limited people’s mobility and severely reduced Active Riders. Revenue per Active\\nRider reached all-time highs in the consecutive periods during the three months ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 primarily driven by an increase in\\nride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airport rides, reflecting increased travel in the second half of 2022 across the United States.\\nRevenue per Active Rider also benefited from revenues from licensing and data access agreements, beginning in the second quarter of 2021.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with\\nGAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\\nrevenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable\\nunder the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results,\\nour future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.\\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most\\ncritical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition\\n55\\nand results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\\nWe generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We recognize revenue from fees paid by drivers\\nfor use of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Drivers enter into terms\\nof service (“ToS”) with us in order to use our Lyft Driver App.\\nWe provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers\\nto find, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our\\nsingle performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.\\nWe evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to\\nthe rider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver\\nto a rider (the driver’s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to provide a transportation service\\nto their customer through use of the Lyft Platform. While we facilitate setting the price for transportation services, the drivers and riders have the discretion in accepting\\nthe transaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the\\ntransportation services. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.\\nWe report revenue on a\\xa0net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from\\nthe rider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with\\ndrivers to provide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not\\ncontrol the provision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.\\nWe consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract exists\\nbetween the driver and us when the driver’s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related charges from\\nriders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining\\ndisbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.\\nWe earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the\\namount earned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare arrangement,\\nas we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver’s actions which\\nmay not be fully mitigated. We earn a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in\\ninstances where an up-front quoted fare offered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.\\nWe recognize revenue upon completion of a ride as the single performance obligation is satisfied and we have the right to receive payment for the services\\nrendered upon the completion of the ride.\\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if we\\ncannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\\nIn some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to request\\nrides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a percentage of\\nthe ride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.\\nWe recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over the\\napplicable subscription period.\\nWe also recognize revenue from car maintenance, roadside assistance, parking and collision repair services and revenue from bikes and bike station hardware\\nand software sales. These revenues are not material to the Company’s consolidated revenue.\\nWe generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling our promise to provide rideshare data and access to\\nFlexdrive vehicles and bear the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. We act as a principal in delivering the data and\\naccess licenses and present revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery and vehicle access, are determined by\\nassigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratably over the quarter for access\\nto\\n56\\nfleet vehicles as our respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each. These revenues are not material to the Company’s consolidated revenue or\\noperating trends. Refer to Note 4 \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-\\ndriving vehicles division, Level 5.\\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\\nWe generate rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, our network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Under the Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals programs, we\\noperate a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. We either lease or sublease vehicles to\\ndrivers and Lyft Rentals renters, as a result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. For\\nvehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements.\\nDrivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which we collect from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft Platform.\\nRevenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicles riders are recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from\\nFlexdrive and Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals,\\nand Light Vehicle transactions, we classify these rentals as operating leases.\\nInsurance Reserves\\nWe utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or\\nreinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection\\nunder state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that\\nhave been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are\\ndetermined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information\\nand application of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for\\nappropriateness with claims reserve valuations.\\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make\\ncertain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as one of the most significant assumptions, and\\nutilize actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains\\nopen, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at\\na rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However,\\nwhile we believe that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts\\nthat will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated\\nbalance sheets. We continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as\\nsettled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.\\nOn April 22, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. (“PVIC”), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement (the\\n“Reinsurance Agreement”) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (“DARAG”), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based on reserves\\nin place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded\\nto DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with\\nan aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (the “Reinsurance Transaction”). Losses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement that exceed\\n$271.5 million, but are below the aggregate limit of $434.5 million, resulted in the recognition of a deferred gain liability. The deferred gain liability was amortized and\\nrecognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlement period of the ceded reserves\\nwas based on the life-to-date cumulative losses collected and extended over periods longer than a quarter. The amount of the deferral that was amortized was\\nrecalculated each period based on loss payments and updated estimates of the portfolio’s total losses. When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries were\\nuncertain, the recovery method was used to calculate the amount of amortization in period. The deferral of gains had a negative impact in respective periods to cost of\\nrevenue as the losses on direct liabilities were not offset by gains from excess benefits under the Reinsurance Agreement. The amortization of these deferred gains\\nprovided a benefit to cost of revenue over multiple periods equal to the excess benefits received.\\nOn June 21, 2022, PVIC and DARAG completed the Commutation Transaction, which effectively commuted and settled the previous Reinsurance Agreement.\\nAs a result of the Commutation Transaction, the Company recognized a $36.8 million gain in cost of revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2022, including\\namortization of a portion of the previously recognized deferred gain. Refer to Note 6 “Supplemental Financial Statement Information - Commutation of the\\nReinsurance Agreement” to the consolidated\\n57\\nfinancial statements for information regarding this transaction. Refer to Note 6 “Supplemental Financial Statement Information” to the consolidated financial\\nstatements for information regarding these transactions.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe incur stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (“PSUs”) and stock purchase rights granted under our\\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).\\nWe estimate the fair value of ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize compensation expense related to the ESPP\\npurchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.\\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs are estimated based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, which is based on the closing price of\\nour Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.\\nCompensation expense for RSUs is generally recognized based on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense is\\nbased on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent\\nperiods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. As of December\\xa031, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs was $499.5 million, which\\nwe expect to recognize over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.0 year.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of\\npurchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair\\nvalue of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired\\nand liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon\\nassumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the\\nmeasurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period,\\nany subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business\\ncombination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by us based on the fair\\nvalue of assets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.\\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative\\nassessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the\\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amounts, the quantitative impairment test will be required. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently issued accounting pronouncements\\nnot yet adopted as of the date of this report.\\xa0\\nComponents of Results of Operations\\nAs noted above, we expect the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to suppress demand for our platform. While we have seen recovery in\\nlevels of demand due to the availability of vaccines and reopening of communities, we cannot be certain when conditions will return to pre-pandemic levels.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations that use\\nour Concierge offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from our vehicle service centers, revenue\\nfrom the bikes and bike station hardware and software sales and revenue from licensing and data access agreements. Revenue derived from these offerings are\\nrecognized in accordance with ASC 606\\n58\\nas described in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue also consists of rental revenues recognized through leases or subleases primarily from Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and our network of Light Vehicles,\\nwhich includes revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by riders of Light Vehicles. Revenue derived from these offerings are recognized in accordance with\\nASC 842 as described in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if we\\ncannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\\nCost of Revenue\\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through our multimodal platform which primarily includes\\ninsurance costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing\\nand bike and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers in California. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks\\nand failed charges. Other costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, personnel-related compensation costs, depreciation,\\namortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges and costs related to Flexdrive, which include vehicle lease expenses and remarketing gains\\nand losses related to the sale of vehicles. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue.\\nOperations and Support\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email and\\nchat support to users, Light Vehicle fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, fees paid to third-parties providing operations\\nsupport, facility costs and certain car rental fleet support costs. Light Vehicle fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other customer\\nsupport activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs related to\\nautonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nOn July 13, 2021, we completed a transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our\\nself-driving vehicle division, Level 5, and as a result, certain costs related to our prior initiative to develop self-driving systems were eliminated beginning in the third\\nquarter of 2021.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders,\\nadvertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that are\\ngenerally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative fees, policy\\nspend, depreciation, facility costs and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.\\nInterest Expense\\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest incurred on our 2025 Notes, as well as the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and debt discount.\\nInterest expense also includes interest incurred on our Non-Revolving Loan and our Master Vehicle Loan.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of an impairment charge related to a non-marketable equity investment and other assets in 2022, a pre-tax gain\\nas a result of the transaction with Woven Planet in 2021, interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, sublease income and restricted and unrestricted short-term\\ninvestments.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\n59\\nOur provision for income taxes consists of federal and state taxes in the U.S. and foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. As we expand the\\nscale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our overall provision for income taxes in the\\nfuture.\\nWe have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. We expect to maintain\\nthis valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized.\\n60\\nResults of Operations\\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations data:\\nYear Ended December\\xa031,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n(in thousands)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n4,095,135\\xa0\\n$\\n3,208,323\\xa0\\n$\\n2,364,681\\xa0\\nCosts and expenses\\nCost of revenue\\n2,435,736\\xa0\\n1,702,317\\xa0\\n1,447,516\\xa0\\nOperations and support\\n443,846\\xa0\\n402,233\\xa0\\n453,963\\xa0\\nResearch and development\\n856,777\\xa0\\n911,946\\xa0\\n909,126\\xa0\\nSales and marketing\\n531,512\\xa0\\n411,406\\xa0\\n416,331\\xa0\\nGeneral and administrative\\n1,286,180\\xa0\\n915,638\\xa0\\n946,127\\xa0\\nTotal costs and expenses\\n5,554,051\\xa0\\n4,343,540\\xa0\\n4,173,063\\xa0\\nLoss from operations\\n(1,458,916)\\n(1,135,217)\\n(1,808,382)\\nInterest expense\\n(19,735)\\n(51,635)\\n(32,678)\\nOther income (expense), net\\n(99,988)\\n135,933\\xa0\\n43,669\\xa0\\nLoss before income taxes\\n(1,578,639)\\n(1,050,919)\\n(1,797,391)\\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\\n5,872\\xa0\\n11,225\\xa0\\n(44,534)\\nNet loss\\n$\\n(1,584,511)\\n$\\n(1,062,144)\\n$\\n(1,752,857)\\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:\\nYear Ended December\\xa031,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nRevenue\\n100.0\\xa0%\\n100.0\\xa0%\\n100.0\\xa0%\\nCosts and expenses\\nCost of revenue\\n59.5\\xa0\\n53.1\\xa0\\n61.2\\xa0\\nOperations and support\\n10.8\\xa0\\n12.5\\xa0\\n19.2\\xa0\\nResearch and development\\n20.9\\xa0\\n28.4\\xa0\\n38.4\\xa0\\nSales and marketing\\n13.0\\xa0\\n12.8\\xa0\\n17.6\\xa0\\nGeneral and administrative\\n31.4\\xa0\\n28.5\\xa0\\n40.0\\xa0\\nTotal costs and expenses\\n135.6\\xa0\\n135.4\\xa0\\n176.5\\xa0\\nLoss from operations\\n(35.6)\\n(35.4)\\n(76.5)\\nInterest expense\\n(0.5)\\n(1.6)\\n(1.4)\\nOther income (expense), net\\n(2.4)\\n4.2\\xa0\\n1.8\\xa0\\nLoss before income taxes\\n(38.5)\\n(32.8)\\n(76.0)\\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\\n0.1\\xa0\\n0.3\\xa0\\n(1.9)\\nNet loss\\n(38.7)%\\n(33.1)%\\n(74.1)%\\nComparison of Years Ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021\\nRevenue\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 to 2021\\n% change\\n2021 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n4,095,135\\xa0\\n$\\n3,208,323\\xa0\\n$\\n2,364,681\\xa0\\n28\\xa0%\\n36\\xa0%\\nRevenue increased $886.8\\xa0million, or 28%, in 2022 as compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the increase in the number of Active Riders throughout\\n2022 as demand continued to recover from the impacts of COVID-19. Active Riders increased 31.9%, 15.9%, 7.2%, and 8.7% for the quarters ended March 31, 2022,\\nJune 30, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022,\\n61\\nrespectively, as compared to the same quarters in the prior year and Revenue per Active Rider increased 9.0%, 11.8%, 13.7% and 11.5% for the quarters ended March\\n31, 2022, June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the same quarters in the prior year. These increases to Active Riders\\nand Revenue per Active Rider reflect the improvement in demand on the Company’s platform and improving marketplace health in 2022 as compared to the same\\nperiods in 2021 during which the COVID-19 pandemic had a stronger impact. This improvement was most significant for Active Riders in the first half of 2022 as\\ncompared to the earlier stages of the COVID-19 recovery in the first half of 2021. Revenue also benefited from revenues from licensing and data access agreements,\\nbeginning in the second quarter of 2021. Investments in driver supply, which are recorded as a reduction to revenue, increased by $38.5\\xa0million in 2022 as compared to\\nthe prior year.\\nIn the near term, we expect to see revenue headwinds due to the current competitive environment, which have resulted in reductions in pricing. We expect to\\ncontinue to see improved marketplace balance as increasing driver supply better meets demand, which will reduce the absolute dollar amount earned from high value\\nrides during peak hours. In the first quarter of 2023, we also expect headwinds as a result of seasonality in both ridesharing and our network of Light Vehicles during\\nthe winter months. Lastly, we cannot predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on work, travel and lifestyle trends, or the impact a deteriorating\\nmacroeconomic environment will have on consumer behavior, and these factors could affect future revenue.\\nCost of Revenue\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 to 2021\\n% change\\n2021 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n2,435,736\\xa0\\n$\\n1,702,317\\xa0\\n$\\n1,447,516\\xa0\\n43\\xa0%\\n18\\xa0%\\nCost of revenue increased $733.4 million, or 43%, in 2022 as compared to the prior year. The increase was due primarily to a $669.5\\xa0million increase in\\ninsurance costs driven by an increase in rider demand and recent economic factors including the high inflationary environment, increased litigation, and higher than\\nexpected losses across the commercial auto industry. This includes an increase in estimates to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies of\\n$342.9\\xa0 million, of which $225.0\\xa0 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2022. These factors were partly offset by a gain of $36.8\\xa0 million related to the\\nCommutation Transaction in the second quarter of 2022, which effectively commuted and settled the Reinsurance Agreement, and a decrease of $20.2\\xa0million in\\ntransaction costs related to the reinsurance of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities from the second quarter of 2021. Cost of revenue was also affected by increases of\\n$75.3\\xa0million in transaction fees, $26.4\\xa0million in Light Vehicle related costs and $11.6\\xa0million in web hosting fees. These increases were offset by a $37.3\\xa0million\\ndecrease in Flexdrive related costs inclusive of gains on sale of vehicles.\\nWe may see cost of revenue headwinds to insurance costs driven by uncertainties of recent economic factors including the high inflationary environment.\\nOperations and Support\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 to 2021\\n% change\\n2021 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nOperations and support\\n$\\n443,846\\xa0\\n$\\n402,233\\xa0\\n$\\n453,963\\xa0\\n10\\xa0%\\n(11)%\\nOperations and support expenses increased $41.6\\xa0million, or 10%, in 2022 as compared to the prior year. There was a $19.8 million increase in Light Vehicle\\nfleet operations support costs and a $12.5 million increase in driver onboarding costs and rider and driver support costs due to an increase in ride volume as compared\\nto the prior year. The increase was also due to $18.7 million in restructuring costs related to the restructuring event in the fourth quarter of 2022, consisting of (i) $8.7\\nmillion in accelerated\\n62\\ndepreciation of fixed assets, (ii) $5.2 million in severance and benefits costs and (iii) $4.9 million in impairment costs of operating lease right-of-use assets and other\\ncosts.\\nResearch and Development\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 to 2021\\n% change\\n2021 to 2020 %\\nChange\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nResearch and development\\n$\\n856,777\\xa0\\n$\\n911,946\\xa0\\n$\\n909,126\\xa0\\n(6)%\\n—\\xa0%\\nResearch and development expenses decreased $55.2\\xa0million, or 6%, in 2022 as compared to the prior year.

There were also reduced Level 5 costs partially driven by the transaction with Woven Planet, including\\ndecreases of $7.9\\xa0million in web hosting fees and $7.5\\xa0million in autonomous vehicle research costs. There was also a decrease of $9.1\\xa0million in consulting and\\nadvisory costs.

We believe Contribution and\\nContribution Margin are key measures of our ability to achieve profitability.\\nWe define Contribution as gross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude the following items from cost of revenue:\\n•\\namortization of intangible assets;\\n•\\nstock-based compensation expense;\\n•\\npayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\\n•\\nnet amount from claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement;\\n•\\ntransaction costs related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities, if any; and\\n•\\nrestructuring charges, if any.\\nFor more information about cost of revenue, see the section titled “Components of Results of Operations—Cost of Revenue.”\\nContribution Margin is calculated by dividing Contribution for a period by revenue for the same period.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, we entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement for the reinsurance of legacy auto insurance liabilities between\\nOctober 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, based on the reserves in place as of March 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a Novation Agreement for the\\ntransfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2018. Refer to Note 6 “Supplemental Financial Statement Information”\\nto the consolidated financial statements for information regarding these transactions. We believe the costs associated with these transactions related to certain legacy\\nauto insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations despite this transaction occurring in the current period because the\\nimpacted insurance liabilities relate to claims that date back years. We believe the adjustment to exclude these costs associated with transactions related to legacy\\ninsurance liabilities from Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of\\ncurrent period results and provide for better comparability with our historically disclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA amounts.\\nLosses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement that exceeded $271.5\\xa0million, but were below the aggregate limit of $434.5\\xa0million, resulted in the recognition\\nof a deferred gain liability. The deferral of gains had a negative impact in the respective period to cost of revenue as the losses on direct liabilities were not offset by\\ngains from excess benefits under the Reinsurance Agreement. The amortization of these deferred gains provided a benefit to the cost of revenue over multiple periods\\nequal to the excess benefits received. We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance\\nAgreement, including any related reserve adjustments and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be excluded to show the ultimate economic\\nbenefit of the Reinsurance Agreement. This adjustment will help investors understand the economic benefit of our Reinsurance Agreement on future trends in our\\noperations, as they improve over the settlement period of any deferred gains. Therefore, in the event that the net amount of any reserve adjustments and any benefits\\nfrom deferred gains related to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement is recognized on the statement of operations, those amounts will be excluded from the\\ncalculation of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of the “Net amount from claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement”. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, we have $2.4 million of deferred gain related to losses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement which is included within accrued and other current\\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\\n65\\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we completed the Commutation Transaction, which effectively commuted and settled the Reinsurance Agreement. The\\nCommutation Transaction resulted in a $36.8\\xa0million gain recorded to cost of revenue on the consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Note 6 “Supplemental\\nFinancial Statement Information” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding these transactions. We believe the adjustment to exclude this gain\\nassociated with the commutation of the Reinsurance Agreement from Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our\\noperating performance in the context of current period results and provide for better comparability with our historically disclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA\\namounts. The gain associated with this Commutation Agreement, which commutes and settles the Reinsurance Agreement, will be excluded from the calculation of\\nContribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of the “Net amount from claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement.”\\nWe announced a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2022 to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows. We believe the costs associated with the\\nrestructuring do not reflect current period performance of our ongoing operations. We believe the adjustment to exclude the costs related to restructuring from\\nContribution and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period results and\\nprovide for better comparability with our historically disclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA amounts.\\nFor more information regarding the limitations of Contribution and Contribution Margin and a reconciliation of gross profit to Contribution, see the section\\ntitled \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the\\noperating leverage in our business. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on\\na more consistent basis, we use these measures for business planning purposes. We expect Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin will increase over the long\\nterm as we continue to scale our business and achieve greater efficiencies in our operating expenses.\\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for:\\n•\\ninterest expense;\\n•\\nother income (expense), net;\\n•\\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes;\\n•\\ndepreciation and amortization;\\n•\\nstock-based compensation;\\n•\\npayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\\n•\\nnet amount from claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement;\\n•\\nsublease income;\\n•\\ncosts related to acquisitions and divestitures, if any; and\\n•\\nrestructuring charges, if any.\\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period.\\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, we entered into subleases for certain offices as part of the transaction with Woven Planet. Sublease income is included within\\nother income on our consolidated statement of operations, while the related lease expense is included within our operating expenses and loss from operations. Sublease\\nincome was immaterial prior to the third quarter of 2021. We believe the adjustment to include sublease income to Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling\\nthem to better assess our operating performance, including the benefits of recent transactions, by presenting sublease income as a contra-expense to the related lease\\ncharges within our operating expenses.\\nFor more information regarding the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, see\\nthe section titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nWe use Contribution, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall\\nassessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies,\\nand to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and\\ntherefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these measures have certain limitations in\\nthat they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary\\n66\\nto run our business. Thus, our Contribution, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be considered in addition to, not as\\nsubstitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of Contribution, and Adjusted EBITDA to the related GAAP financial measures, revenue,\\nnet loss, and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, respectively. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not\\nto rely on any single financial measure and to view Contribution, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with their\\nrespective related GAAP financial measures.\\n67\\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of gross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, to Contribution (in millions):\\nYear Ended December\\xa031,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n(in millions)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n4,095.1\\xa0\\n$\\n3,208.3\\xa0\\n$\\n2,364.7\\xa0\\nLess cost of revenue\\n(2,435.7)\\n(1,702.3)\\n(1,447.5)\\nGross profit\\n1,659.4\\xa0\\n1,506.0\\xa0\\n917.2\\xa0\\nGross profit margin\\n40.5\\xa0%\\n46.9\\xa0%\\n38.8\\xa0%\\nAdjusted to exclude the following (as related to cost of revenue):\\nAmortization of intangible assets\\n5.0\\xa0\\n11.0\\xa0\\n12.0\\xa0\\nStock-based compensation expense\\n44.1\\xa0\\n39.5\\xa0\\n28.7\\xa0\\nPayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation\\n1.2\\xa0\\n1.8\\xa0\\n1.5\\xa0\\nNet amount from claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement\\n18.5\\xa0\\n52.8\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nTransactions related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities\\n—\\xa0\\n20.2\\xa0\\n62.5\\xa0\\nRestructuring charges\\n1.6\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n3.5\\xa0\\nContribution\\n$\\n1,729.8\\xa0\\n$\\n1,631.3\\xa0\\n$\\n1,025.4\\xa0\\nContribution Margin\\n42.2\\xa0%\\n50.8\\xa0%\\n43.4\\xa0%\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nReflects the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement, including any losses related to the deferral gains on the statement of\\noperations and any benefit from the amortization of the deferred gain in the same period, to help investors understand the ultimate economic benefit of the Reinsurance Agreement.\\n(2)\\nIncludes a $36.8 million gain recognized in cost of revenue in the second quarter of 2022 on the consolidated statement of operations related to the Commutation Transaction, which effectively\\ncommuted and settled the Reinsurance Agreement.

This consisted primarily of a net loss of $1.6 billion. This was\\noffset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $750.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $154.8 million and impairment charges of $135.7\\nmillion.\\nCash used in operating activities was $101.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This consisted primarily of a net loss of $1.1 billion and a $119.3\\nmillion pre-tax gain from the transaction with Woven Planet.

Cash and cash equivalents consisted of institutional money market funds, certificates of deposits, commercial paper and\\ncorporate bonds that have an original maturity of less than three months and are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Also included in cash and cash\\nequivalents are certain money market deposit accounts and cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions. Short-term investments\\nconsisted of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and term deposits, which mature in 12 months or less. Restricted cash, cash equivalents and\\ninvestments consisted primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance purposes and amounts pledged to\\nsecure certain letters of credit.\\nIn November 3, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with certain lenders which provides for a $420 million revolving secured credit facility\\nmaturing on the earlier of (i) November 3, 2027 and (ii) February 13, 2025, if, as of such date, the Company’s Liquidity (as defined in the revolving credit agreement)\\nminus the aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2025 Notes outstanding on such date is less than $1.25 billion. We are obligated to pay interest on loans under\\nthe credit facility and other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee. The interest rate for the\\ncredit facility is determined based on calculations using certain market rates as set forth in the credit agreement. In addition, the credit facility contains restrictions on\\npayments including cash payments of dividends. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility, with a sublimit of $168\\xa0million\\nfor the issuance of letters of credit. At closing,\\n70\\n$53.5\\xa0million in letters of credit were issued under the Revolving Credit Facility and as of December\\xa031, 2022, no amounts had been drawn under the credit facility.\\nWe collect the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers at the time the ride is delivered using the rider’s authorized payment method, and we\\nretain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement to drivers. Accordingly, we maintain no accounts receivable from drivers. Our contracts with\\ninsurance providers require reinsurance premiums to be deposited into trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which the insurance providers are\\nreimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments were $1.0 billion as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021.\\nWe continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in March 2020, the pandemic and responses thereto contributed to a severe\\ndecrease in the number of rides on our platform and revenue which had a significant effect on our cash flows from operations. While conditions have improved, these\\nimpacts are ongoing. We also made adjustments to our expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenues including the transaction with Woven Planet\\ncompleted on July 13, 2021 and headcount reductions in 2020 and 2022. Refer to Note 4 \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial statements for information\\nregarding the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we committed to a plan of termination to\\nreduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows. We have also incurred restructuring charges related to the exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to align\\nwith our anticipated operating needs in fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.\\nWe cannot be certain that our actions will mitigate some or all of the continuing negative effects of the pandemic and its impact on work, travel and lifestyle\\ntrends on our business. With $1.8 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December\\xa031, 2022, as well as our credit facility, we\\nbelieve we have sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability to attract and retain drivers and riders on our\\nplatform, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, actual insurance payments\\nfor which we have made reserves, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in\\nbusinesses, products, services and technologies. For example, we intend to invest further in EVs in order to achieve compliance with the California Clean Miles\\nStandard and Incentive Program, which sets the target that 90% of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030, and New York City’s recently\\nannounced goals to get to 100% of rideshare miles in EV by 2030. These targets align with our goal to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. From\\ntime to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations, or to\\nrefinance our existing or future indebtedness. In the event that we decide, or are required, to seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise\\nit on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected.\\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December\\xa031, 2022 (in millions):\\nPayments Due by Period\\nTotal\\n12 months or less\\nThereafter\\nOperating lease commitments\\n$\\n261.5\\xa0\\n$\\n66.5\\xa0\\n$\\n195.0\\xa0\\nFinancing lease commitments\\n37.6\\xa0\\n16.5\\xa0\\n21.1\\xa0\\nLong-term debt, including current maturities\\n839.5\\xa0\\n36.3\\xa0\\n803.2\\xa0\\nOther noncancelable agreements\\n325.4\\xa0\\n108.5\\xa0\\n216.9\\xa0\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nThe table excludes insurance reserves due to uncertainties in the timing of settlement of these reserves.\\n(2)\\nIncludes the convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $747.5\\xa0million issued in May 2020 (the \"2025 Notes\").

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates. Such fluctuations to date have not\\nbeen significant.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.8 billion, which consisted primarily of\\ninstitutional money market funds, certificates of deposits, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and term deposits, which each carry a degree of interest rate risk, and\\nrestricted cash, cash equivalents and restricted investments of $1.1 billion. A hypothetical 100 basis points change in interest rates would not have a material impact on\\nour financial condition or results of operations due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had long-term debt of $839.5 million, 88% of which consisted of the fixed-rate Convertible Senior Notes we issued in May\\n2020. A hypothetical 100 basis points change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to immateriality.\\n72\\nItem 8.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and\\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities\\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control\\nover financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered\\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded PBSC Urban Solutions, Inc. (“PBSC”) from\\nits assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during\\n2022. We have also excluded PBSC from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. PBSC is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenue\\nexcluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represents approximately 2% and 1%, respectively, of the related\\nconsolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n74\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated\\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)\\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit\\nmatter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party\\ninsurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto\\nphysical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. As of December\\n31, 2022, insurance reserves totaled $1,417 million. Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the\\nloss development factors as one of the most significant assumptions and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. Liabilities are determined on a\\nquarterly basis through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development\\nfactors among other inputs and assumptions.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) the\\nsignificant judgment by management when developing the estimated insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort\\nin performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves; (ii) the significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the\\nactuarial valuation methods and the loss development factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves, including the controls over the development\\nof the actuarial valuation methods and the loss development factors. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized\\nskill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the insurance reserves for certain reserve segments and comparison of this independent estimate\\nto management’s actuarially determined reserves. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of historical data provided by\\nmanagement, and independently developing loss development factors.\\n/s/

Statements\\n1.\\xa0Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\\nOrganization and Description of Business\\nLyft, Inc. (the “Company” or “Lyft”) is incorporated in Delaware with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. The Company operates multimodal\\ntransportation networks in the United States and Canada that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based\\napplications. This network enables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers who have a vehicle with\\nriders who need a ride. The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where drivers can be matched with riders via the Lyft App where the Company operates as a\\ntransportation network company (“TNC”).\\nTransportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connects\\ndrivers and riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada, Lyft’s network of bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”), the Express Drive program,\\nwhere drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements with Flexdrive Services, LLC (“Flexdrive”) or a third party for vehicles that may be used to provide\\nridesharing services on the Lyft Platform, and Lyft Rentals, a consumer offering for users who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use, and Lyft\\nDriver Center and Lyft Car Maintenance, where drivers and riders can request auto maintenance and collision repair services offered through the Lyft Platform in\\ncertain markets. In addition, the Company makes the ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through Lyft Business offerings, such as the Concierge and Lyft\\nPass programs, and generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements associated with the data from the Company\\'s platform, subscription fees, and revenue\\nfrom bikes and bike station hardware and software sales.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and\\ninclude the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\\xa0All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nThe Company uses the U.S. dollar predominantly as the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries. For foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the\\nfunctional currency, gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency balances into U.S. dollars are included on the consolidated statements of operations. For\\nthe foreign subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded\\nto a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\\nReclassification\\nCertain insignificant amounts in the non-cash investing and financing activities supplemental information on the consolidated statements of cash flow for the\\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 have been conformed to the current year presentation. This reclassification did not impact any other amounts\\non the consolidated statements of cash flows, including the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. The remaining consolidated financial\\nstatements were not impacted by this reclassification.\\n2.\\xa0Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and\\nexpenses during the reporting periods.\\xa0The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior\\nexperience, expected future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and\\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\nSignificant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial assets and\\nliabilities, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, leases, indirect tax obligations, legal contingencies, valuation allowance for deferred income taxes, and the\\nvaluation of stock-based compensation.\\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact communities in the United States, Canada, and globally. In March 2020, when it became apparent that\\nCOVID-19 was a pandemic, governments and private businesses - at the recommendation of public health officials - began enacting precautions to mitigate the spread\\nof the virus. Although there has been an improvement in demand and marketplace health, demand for the Company’s platform has not returned to pre-pandemic levels\\nin all markets and the exact timing, pace, and sustainability of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which the Company’s operations will continue to be\\nimpacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately\\n83\\npredicted, including new information which may emerge. As of the date of issuance of the financial statements, the Company is not aware of any material event or\\ncircumstance that would require it to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of the Company\\'s assets or liabilities, including the recording of any\\ncredit losses. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and could lead to impairment of long lived assets or goodwill, or\\ncredit losses associated with investments or other assets, and the impact of such changes on estimates will be recognized on the consolidated financial statements as\\nsoon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company\\'s financial statements.\\nSegment Information\\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief\\nOperating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive\\nOfficer is the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating\\nresources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment. During the years ended December\\xa031,\\n2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have material\\nassets located outside of the United States.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nThe Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft\\nPlatform and mobile-based applications. Substantially all, or approximately 85% or more, of the Company’s revenue is generated from its ridesharing marketplace that\\nconnects drivers and riders and is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”). In addition, the Company generates\\nrevenue in accordance with ASC 606 from licensing and data access, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies, subscription fees, auto maintenance\\nand collision repair services and revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales, which are not material components of the Company’s consolidated\\nrevenues. The Company also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Rentals, which is recognized in accordance with\\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (“ASC 842”).\\nThe table below presents the Company\\'s revenues as included on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nRevenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606)\\n$\\n3,811,993\\xa0 $\\n2,957,979\\xa0\\n$\\n2,208,656\\xa0\\nRental revenue (ASC 842)\\n283,142\\xa0\\n250,344\\xa0\\n156,025\\xa0\\nTotal revenue\\n$\\n4,095,135\\xa0 $\\n3,208,323\\xa0\\n$\\n2,364,681\\xa0\\n84\\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\\nThe Company recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606. The Company generates revenue from service fees and\\ncommissions (collectively, “fees”) paid by drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete\\nrides via the Lyft App where the Company operates as a TNC. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of each ride. Drivers enter into terms of service\\n(“ToS”) with the Company in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use\\nof the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating\\nthe ability of a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver\\nas revenue, and not the gross amount collected from the rider.\\nAs the Company’s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver’s ability to cancel the ride lapses, which\\ntypically is upon pickup of the rider. The Company’s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a\\nsuccessful transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion\\nof the ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism\\nand retains its fees before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.\\nThe Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over\\nthe applicable subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services and revenue\\nfrom bikes and bike station hardware and software sales in accordance with ASC 606.\\nThe Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide\\nrideshare data and access to Flexdrive vehicles and bears the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. The Company is\\nacting as a principal in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data\\ndelivery and vehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the\\nrideshare data and ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as the Company’s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each. These\\nrevenues are not material to the Company’s consolidated revenue.\\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\\nThe Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Rental revenues are recognized for rental\\nand rental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.\\nThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles\\nleased from third-party leasing companies. The Company either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers\\nitself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease\\npayments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs, as applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions\\nare recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver\\nby deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft Platform.\\nThe Company owns and operates its Light Vehicles in some cities and operates city-owned Light Vehicles in other cities. Though the specific terms of\\narrangements with cities vary, the Company earns operations fees from cities or shares revenue generated by the systems with cities. Light Vehicle revenue is accounted\\nfor under ASC 842 for single-use rides. A single-use ride allows the user to select a specific Light Vehicle at the time the arrangement is entered into and provides the\\nuser the right to control the selected Light Vehicle for the desired term of the arrangement.\\nDue to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenue\\ngenerated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals\\nis recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less.\\nEnterprise and Trade Receivables\\nThe Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider’s authorized payment method. Uncollected fees\\nare included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and represent receivables from (i) participants in the Company’s enterprise\\nprograms (“Enterprise Users”), where the transactions have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have either been invoiced or are unbilled\\nas of the reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not yet settled with third-party payment\\nprocessors. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform\\n85\\nand related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers. The\\nportion of the fare receivable to be remitted to drivers is included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected. As a result of the adoption\\nof Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses\" (“ASC 326”), the Company’s measurement of the allowance for credit losses has\\nbeen augmented to reflect the change from the incurred loss model to the expected credit loss model. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s current\\nestimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise and trade receivables balance. In determining the expected credit losses, the Company considers its\\nhistorical loss experience, the aging of its receivable balance, current economic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact\\ncollectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.\\nThe Company’s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $278.9 million, $196.2\\xa0million and $104.7\\xa0million as\\nof December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company\\'s allowance for credit losses was $11.6 million, $9.3 million and $15.2 million as of December\\xa031,\\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The write-offs were immaterial for the year ended December\\xa031, 2022. The change in the allowance for credit losses for the year\\nended December\\xa031, 2022 was related to $1.9 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $0.4 million of write-offs. The change in the allowance\\nfor credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to $4.5\\xa0million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4\\xa0million of write-offs.\\nThe change in the allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7\\xa0million of additions for provision for expected credit losses\\nand $2.7\\xa0million of write-offs.\\nIncentive Programs\\nThe Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform.\\xa0Drivers generally receive cash\\nincentives while riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters generally receive free or discounted rides under such incentive programs. Incentives provided to\\ndrivers, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not the\\nCompany’s customers, incentives provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.\\nDriver Incentives\\nThe Company offers various incentive programs to drivers, including minimum guaranteed payments, volume-based discounts and performance-based bonus\\npayments. These driver incentives are similar to retrospective volume-based rebates and represent variable consideration that is typically settled within a week. The\\nCompany reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the most\\nlikely outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the\\nCompany does not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver\\nincentives for referring new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the\\npayment or the established fair value of the benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.\\nRideshare Rider Incentives\\nThe Company has several rideshare rider incentive\\xa0programs, which\\xa0are offered\\xa0to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform.\\xa0Generally, the rider\\xa0incentive\\nprograms are as follows:\\n(i)\\nMarket-wide marketing promotions. Market-wide promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific\\nmarket. This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged\\nby the driver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of\\xa0 incentive\\xa0 as a\\nreduction to revenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.\\n(ii)\\nTargeted marketing promotions. Targeted marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft\\xa0Platform to a targeted group of riders. An example\\nis a promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of\\ntime to a targeted group of riders. The Company\\xa0believes that the\\xa0incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides\\nare similar to marketing coupons. These incentives differ from the market-wide marketing promotions because they do not reduce the overall pricing of\\nthe service provided by drivers for a specific market. During the promotion period,\\xa0riders not utilizing an incentive\\xa0would be charged the full\\xa0fare. These\\nincentives represent marketing costs. When a rider\\xa0redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes\\xa0revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of\\nthe incentive is recorded as sales and marketing expense.\\n86\\n(iii)\\nRider referral programs. Under the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completes\\ntheir first ride on the Lyft Platform.\\xa0 The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the\\ncorresponding charge recorded to sales and marketing expense. Referral coupons typically expire\\xa0within one year. The Company estimates breakage using\\nits historical experience. As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.\\nLight Vehicle Rider and Lyft Rentals Renter Incentives\\nIncentives offered to Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters were not material for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021.\\nFor the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, in relation to the driver, rider, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters incentive programs, the\\nCompany recorded $1.4\\xa0billion, $1.3\\xa0billion and $390.8\\xa0million as a reduction to revenue and $109.8\\xa0million, $64.7\\xa0million and $135.0\\xa0million as sales and marketing\\nexpense, respectively.\\nRefunds\\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to riders unsatisfied by the level of service provided by the driver. There is no legal obligation to\\nremunerate such riders nor does the Company issue such credits or refunds to riders on behalf of the drivers. The Company accounts for credits or refunds, which are\\nnot recoverable from the drivers as sales and marketing expenses when incurred. For the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, rider refunds were $21.5\\nmillion, $19.1 million and $18.8 million, respectively. The Company accounts for credits and refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders as cost of revenue and were $7.8\\nmillion and $6.5\\xa0million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders\\nwere not material.\\nCost of Revenue\\nCost of revenue consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through the Company’s multimodal platform which primarily includes\\ninsurance costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing\\nand bike and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed\\ncharges. Other costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, vehicle lease expenses, personnel-related compensation costs,\\ndepreciation, amortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.\\nOperations and Support\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email and\\nchat support to users, bike and scooter fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, facility cost, certain car rental fleet support costs,\\nand fees paid to third-parties providing operations support. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other customer\\nsupport activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs related to the\\nCompany’s autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders,\\nadvertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $162.1\\nmillion, $145.4 million and $102.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that are\\ngenerally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative fees, policy\\nspend, depreciation, facility costs, and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.\\n87\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThe Company incurs stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, PSUs, and ESPP purchase rights.\\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes\\noption-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards.\\xa0 These variables\\ninclude:\\n•\\nper share fair value of the underlying common stock;\\n•\\nexercise price;\\n•\\nexpected term;\\n•\\nrisk-free interest rate;\\n•\\nexpected annual dividend yield; and\\n•\\nexpected stock price volatility over the expected term.\\nThe Company estimates the expected term for stock options using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” stock option awards. The expected term of the\\nESPP purchase rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period.\\xa0Since the Company has limited history\\nas a public company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company\\'s common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP\\npurchase rights using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on\\nU.S.\\xa0Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted.\\nThe fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The\\nCompany recognizes compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.\\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which is determined based\\non the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.\\nCompensation expense for RSUs is generally recognized based on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense is\\nbased on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent\\nperiods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.\\xa0Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based\\non the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.\\xa0These differences are measured\\nusing the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes\\nthe effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its\\ndeferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative,\\nincluding historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the\\nneed for a valuation allowance.\\nUnder the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all positions\\ntaken by the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position\\nmay be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation\\nprocesses, based on the technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of\\nthe income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair\\nvalue of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of\\nthe fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets\\nacquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair\\nvalue are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and\\nliabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.\\nAfter the measurement period, any\\n88\\nsubsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S.\\xa0dollars as well as commercial paper. Cash\\nequivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Also included\\nin cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions.\\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance\\npurposes and amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.\\nInvestments\\nDebt Securities\\nThe Company’s accounting for its investments in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company’s intended holding period for the\\nsecurity, and the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and U.S. government\\nsecurities. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.\\nThe Company considers an available-for-sale debt security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis. The entire\\ndifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the consolidated statements of\\noperations as an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell\\nthe security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or\\nother factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the\\nsecurity by third-party rating agencies, and adverse conditions specific to the security, among other factors. If the Company\\'s assessment indicates that a credit loss\\nexists, the credit loss is measured based on the Company\\'s best estimate of the cash flows expected to be collected. When developing its estimate of cash flows\\nexpected to be collected, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and\\nreasonable and supportable forecasts.\\nCredit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheet\\nwith an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an\\nadjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of December\\xa031, 2022,\\nthe Company had not recorded any credit impairments. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification\\nmethod.\\nThe Company\\'s investments in debt securities include:\\n(i)\\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include certificates of deposits, commercial paper and corporate bonds that have an original\\nmaturity of 90 days or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\\n(ii)\\nShort-term investments. Short-term investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which\\nmature in twelve months or less. As a result, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance\\nsheets.\\n(iii)\\nRestricted investments. Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit,\\ncorporate bonds and U.S. government securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with\\ninsurance providers.\\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\\nThe Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence\\nof observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators of impairment\\nexist. Factors considered in this assessment include the investees’ financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, exposure to industries and markets\\nimpacted by COVID-19, and the time since the last adjustment to fair value, among others. If an impairment exists, the Company estimates the fair value of the\\ninvestment by using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by\\nwhich the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment on the consolidated statements of operations.\\n89\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its\\ncash with multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits.\\xa0The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash\\nand cash equivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of\\ndebt securities to investment-grade securities.\\nFair Value Measurements\\nThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of\\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants\\nwould use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a\\nrecurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to\\nmeasure fair value:\\nLevel 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\\nLevel 2 Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs\\nother than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by\\ncorrelation or other means.\\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be\\nconsistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\\nThe carrying values of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of\\ntime to payment.\\nLight Vehicle Fleet\\nThe Company’s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters. Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid\\nexpenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the\\nscooters, which is less than 12 months. As of December\\xa031, 2022, there were no scooters not yet placed in service and the carrying value of scooters placed in service\\nwas $7.5 million. As of December 31, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service and the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million.\\nDepreciation expense related to scooters was $8.6 million, $5.9\\xa0million and $7.2\\xa0million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Bikes are\\nincluded in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nLeases\\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach with an effective date as of the beginning of the fiscal year, January 1, 2019. The\\nCompany elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward the historical\\nassessments of (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if\\nan arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to\\ncontrol such asset. The Company determines the classification and measurement of its leases upon lease commencement. The Company enters into certain agreements\\nas a lessor and either leases or subleases the underlying asset in the agreement to customers. The Company also enters into certain agreements as a lessee. If any of the\\nfollowing criteria are met, the Company classifies the lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or sales-type lease (both as a lessor):\\n•\\nThe lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;\\n•\\nThe lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;\\n•\\nThe lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of the\\neconomic life of the underlying asset;\\n•\\nThe present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or\\n•\\nThe underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.\\nLeases that do not meet any of the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases.\\nLessor\\nThe Company\\'s lease arrangements include vehicle rentals to drivers or renters under the Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals programs and Light Vehicle rentals to\\nsingle-use riders. Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies\\n90\\nthese leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components, such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its\\nlessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized as revenue in the period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees\\nassessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with each lease revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the\\nlessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements. The Company mitigates residual value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance\\nand repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on the Company\\'s ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market\\nconditions.\\nLessee\\nThe Company\\'s leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services\\non the Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use\\nasset and lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably\\ncertain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but\\nhas elected to do so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to\\naccount for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.\\nThe Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the\\nlease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the\\nCompany would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\\nLease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Company’s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are\\nincluded in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities — current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease costs for the\\nCompany\\'s operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are included in property and\\nequipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis\\nover the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. The interest component of\\nfinance leases is included in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\\nVariable lease payments are recognized primarily in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\\nSimilar to other long-lived assets discussed below, the Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future\\nundiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is\\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the decision to leave a\\nleased facility prior to the end of the minimum lease term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the associated lease. On November\\n3, 2022, the Company committed to a decision to exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to align with the Company’s anticipated operating needs and\\nincurred impairment charges related to real estate operating right-of-use assets of $55.3\\xa0 million. Refer to Note 16 “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial\\nstatements for further information.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life\\nof the related asset, which is generally between two and seven years. Depreciation for property and equipment commences once they are ready for our intended use.\\nMaintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the\\ncost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of\\noperations in the period realized. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease, or the useful life of the assets.\\nConstruction in progress is related to property and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use.\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business\\ncombination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based on management’s estimate of\\nthe fair value of assets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.\\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first\\nperforms a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing\\n91\\nis necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the\\nquantitative impairment test will be required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. There was\\nno impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such events and changes may include: significant changes in performance\\nrelative to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business strategy. The Company\\nmeasures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to\\ngenerate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds\\nits fair value. With the exception of impairment charges related to real estate operating right-of-use assets mentioned above, there was no other material impairment of\\nlong-lived assets recorded for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nThe Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems. The Company capitalizes development costs related to the Lyft\\nPlatform and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to\\nperform the function intended. The Company capitalized $12.1 million, $16.2 million, and $12.8 million of software development costs during the years ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\\nInsurance Reserves\\nThe Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions,\\nto insure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury\\nprotection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and\\nclaims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments.\\nLiabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new\\ninformation and application of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an\\nindependent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.\\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and the Company has available limited historical loss experience because of the limited operational\\nhistory. The Company makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as one of the most\\nsignificant assumptions,\\xa0and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the\\nlength of time the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for\\nevents that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to\\nestimate and could be material. However, while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less\\nthan, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the\\nestimated amounts provided for on the consolidated balance sheets. For example, disruptive factors may distort data, metrics and patterns and result in rapid increases\\nin insurance cost and reserve deficiency. These disruptive factors can include recent economic conditions and ongoing global events such as the high inflationary\\nenvironment, increased litigation, and higher than expected losses across the commercial auto industry as well as the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The\\nCompany continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled, and\\nthe legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.\\nOn April 22, 2021, PVIC entered into a Reinsurance Agreement with DARAG, under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies,\\nbased on reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2\\xa0million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date (the “Reinsurance Transaction”). Under the\\nterms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3\\xa0million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the\\nperiod of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5\\xa0million, for a premium of $271.5\\xa0million. Losses ceded under the Reinsurance\\nAgreement that exceed $271.5\\xa0million, but are below the aggregate limit of $434.5\\xa0million, resulted in the recognition of a deferred gain liability. The deferred gain\\nliability was amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlement\\nperiod of the ceded reserves was based on the life-to-date cumulative losses collected and likely extends over periods longer than a quarter. The amount of the deferral\\nthat was amortized was recalculated each period based on loss payments and updated estimates of the portfolio’s total losses. When the amount and timing of\\n92\\nthe reinsurance recoveries were uncertain, the recovery method was used to calculate the amount of amortization in period. The deferral of gains had a negative impact\\nin the respective period to cost of revenue as the losses on direct liabilities were not offset by gains from excess benefits under the Reinsurance Agreement. The\\namortization of these deferred gains provided a benefit to cost of revenue over multiple periods equal to the excess benefits received. Deferred gain liabilities for the\\nReinsurance Transaction are included in accruals and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nOn June 21, 2022, PVIC and DARAG completed a transaction to effectively commute and settle the previous Reinsurance Agreement. Refer to Note 6\\n\"Supplemental Financial Statement Information - Commutation of the Reinsurance Agreement\" to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this\\ntransaction.\\nNet Loss Per Share\\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating\\nsecurities. The two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or\\naccumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated\\nbetween common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The\\nCompany’s redeemable convertible preferred stock contractually entitles the holders of such shares to participate in dividends but does not contractually require the\\nholders of such shares to participate in the Company’s losses. There were no redeemable convertible preferred shares issued and outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2022\\nand 2021.\\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less\\nshares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in\\nwhich the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share\\nattributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nIn accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation, the Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to assess whether it has a variable\\ninterest in entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are variable interest entities (“VIEs”). These evaluations are complex,\\ninvolving judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. For an entity to qualify as\\na VIE, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and, if so, to consolidate such entity into its consolidated\\nfinancial statements.\\nThe Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest and is therefore deemed the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest\\nwill have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the VIE activities that most significantly impact economic performance; and (b) the obligation to\\nabsorb the VIE losses and the right to receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company reevaluates its ownership, contractual and other\\ninterests in entities to determine whether any changes in its interest or relationship with an entity impacts the determination of whether it is still the primary beneficiary\\nof such entity. The Company has determined that it was the primary beneficiary of one VIE as of December 31, 2022.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—\\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”, which simplifies the\\naccounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features\\nare not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in\\ncapital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded\\nconversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the\\ndiluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted\\nearnings per share calculations. This new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within\\nthose fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2022, using the modified retrospective method. In the consolidated balance sheets, the\\nadoption of this new guidance resulted in:\\n•\\nan increase of $133.5\\xa0million to the total carrying value of the convertible senior notes to reflect the full principal amount of the convertible notes outstanding\\nnet of issuance costs,\\n•\\na reduction of $140.0\\xa0 million (net of tax) to additional paid-in capital to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features\\nassociated with the convertible notes, and\\n93\\n•\\na cumulative-effect adjustment of $6.5\\xa0million (net of tax) to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2022.\\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from\\nContracts with Customers” (“ASU 2021-08”), which requires companies to apply the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts\\nwith Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities relating to contracts with customers that are acquired in a business combination. This\\nwill result in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under\\nASC Topic 606. This new standard will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within that fiscal\\nyear, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 in the second quarter of 2022 on a prospective basis. There were no acquisitions in the first\\nquarter of 2022.\\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, which defers the sunset date of “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)”, from December 31, 2022 to\\nDecember 31, 2024. ASC 848 provides temporary relief relating to the potential accounting impact relating to the replacement of LIBOR or other reference rates\\nexpected to be discounted as a result of reference rate reform. ASU 2022-06 is effective immediately for all entities.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual\\nSale Restrictions”, which clarifies guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, when measuring the fair value of an equity security to contractual restrictions that\\nprohibit the sale of an equity security and to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair\\nvalue in accordance with Topic 820. This new standard will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods\\nwithin that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\\n3.\\xa0Acquisitions\\nAcquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc. (\"PBSC\")\\nOn May 17, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of one hundred percent of PBSC\\'s outstanding equity, a global leader in\\nbikeshare that supplies stations and bikes to markets internationally, for a total purchase price of $163.5 million inclusive of $14.1\\xa0million in estimated fair value of\\ncontingent consideration. The acquisition was treated as a business combination and increases the Company’s scale in micromobility by leveraging PBSC’s deep sales\\nexperience and customer relationships.\\nAcquisition costs were immaterial and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe earn out incentives, ranging from zero to $15.0\\xa0 million, is included in contingent consideration on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 at a fair value of $15.0\\xa0million. The earn out incentives are based on hardware and software for new system sales, either earned or committed\\nduring the earn out period. It will be remeasured on a recurring basis at fair value. To estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liability, management\\nutilized an option-pricing model to value the earn out based on the likelihood of reaching firm-specific targets. Significant inputs used in the calculations include\\nprobability of success, duration of the earn-out and discount rate.\\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Closing Date (in thousands):\\n94\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n2,665\\xa0\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n34,845\\xa0\\nOther investments\\n22,175\\xa0\\nProperty and equipment\\n2,202\\xa0\\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n786\\xa0\\nIdentifiable intangible assets\\n45,047\\xa0\\nTotal identifiable assets acquired\\n107,720\\xa0\\nAccounts payable\\n6,004\\xa0\\nAccrued and other liabilities\\n3,344\\xa0\\nOperating lease liabilities — current\\n292\\xa0\\nOperating lease liabilities\\n494\\xa0\\nOther liabilities\\n14,678\\xa0\\nTotal liabilities assumed\\n24,812\\xa0\\nNon-controlling interest (recorded to equity)\\n140\\xa0\\nNet assets assumed\\n82,768\\xa0\\nGoodwill\\n80,748\\xa0\\nTotal acquisition consideration\\n$\\n163,516\\xa0\\nThe purchase accounting for the acquisition of PBSC remains incomplete with respect to certain opening current asset and liability balances. Additionally,\\nidentifiable intangible assets, deferred tax liabilities and purchase consideration, may be adjusted as management continues to gather and evaluate information about\\ncircumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments will be recognized prospectively. The measurement period is not to exceed 12\\nmonths from the date of acquisition\\nThe Company adopted ASU 2021-08 on April 1, 2022, prior to the acquisition of PBSC, the Company\\'s only acquisition in 2022. Upon the adoption of this\\nupdate, contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) acquired in a business combination are recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition\\ndate in accordance with ASC 606 as if the acquirer had originated the contracts, which would generally result in an acquirer recognizing and measuring acquired\\ncontract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquiree’s financial statements. Therefore, PBSC’s historical\\ndeferred revenue balance as of May 17, 2022 has been included in the purchase price allocation in accordance with ASU 2021-08.\\nThe goodwill is attributable to (i) expanded sales opportunities for the Company\\'s current products and services by leveraging PBSC\\'s assembled workforce\\nand (ii) cost synergies associated with economies of scale and a streamlined supply chain as the combined businesses operate on a global scale. The acquisition is a\\nnon-taxable business combination and goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.\\nThe Company recorded intangible assets at their fair value, which consisted of the following (in thousands):\\nEstimated useful life (in\\nyears)\\nAmount\\nTradename\\n2\\n$\\n1,009\\xa0\\nCustomer relationships – cities\\n7 - 11\\n22,157\\xa0\\nDeveloped technology (hardware and software)\\n2 - 3\\n21,881\\xa0\\nTotal intangible assets\\n$\\n45,047\\xa0\\nThe fair value of the tradename was determined to be $1.0 million with an estimated useful life of two years. The fair value of the tradename was determined\\nusing the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This involves forecasting avoided royalties, reducing them by taxes and discounting the resulting net\\ncash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate.\\nThe fair value of the contractual relationships – cities was determined to be $22.2 million with estimated useful lives between seven years and eleven years.\\nThe fair value of the contractual relationships – cities was determined using the multi-period excess earnings. The multi-period excess earnings approach involves\\nforecasting the net earnings expected to be generated by the asset, reducing them by appropriate returns on contributory assets, and then discounting the resulting net\\ncash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate.\\nThe fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $21.9 million with an estimated useful life between two years and three\\nyears. The fair value of the developed technology was determined using the replacement cost approach. In the replacement cost approach, the fair value of an asset is\\nbased on the cost of a market participant to reconstruct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for any obsolescence. The fair value of the asset would include\\nthe expected profit margin a\\n95\\nhypothetical third party developer would charge and a market participant buyer\\'s opportunity costs lost over the period to reconstruct the substitute asset.\\nJudgment was applied for a number of assumptions in valuing the identified intangible assets, including revenue and cash flow forecasts, technology life,\\nroyalty rate, obsolescence and discount rate.\\nRefer to Note 17 “Variable Interest Entities” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the variable interest entities included in this\\ntransaction.\\nThe results of operations for the acquired business have been included in the consolidated statements of operations for the period subsequent to the Company\\'s\\nacquisition of PBSC. PBSC’s results of operations for periods prior to this acquisition were not material to the consolidated statements of operations and, accordingly,\\npro forma financial information has not been presented.\\nAcquisition of Flexdrive Services, LLC (“Flexdrive”)\\nOn February 7, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of Flexdrive for approximately $20.0 million and treated the acquisition as a\\nbusiness combination. The acquisition is expected to contribute to the growth of the Company\\'s current business, and help expand the range of the Company\\'s use\\ncases. Prior to the acquisition, the Company acted as the lessee of Flexdrive’s vehicles and sublessor for each vehicle prior to its rental by drivers. As of the Closing\\nDate, the Company had approximately $133.1 million of operating lease right-of-use assets and $130.1 million of operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet related\\nto this preexisting contractual relationship with Flexdrive. This preexisting contractual relationship and others were settled on the Closing Date as an adjustment to the\\npurchase price, resulting in a total acquisition consideration paid of $13.0 million.\\nAcquisition costs were immaterial and are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2020.\\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Closing Date (in thousands):\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n587\\xa0\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n276\\xa0\\nProperty and equipment\\n111,881\\xa0\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\n56,014\\xa0\\nIdentifiable intangible assets - developed technology\\n13,200\\xa0\\nTotal identifiable assets acquired\\n181,958\\xa0\\nLoans\\n134,121\\xa0\\nFinance lease & other liabilities\\n57,265\\xa0\\nTotal liabilities assumed\\n191,386\\xa0\\nNet liabilities assumed\\n(9,428)\\nGoodwill\\n22,455\\xa0\\nTotal acquisition consideration\\n$\\n13,027\\xa0\\nGoodwill represents the excess of the total purchase consideration over the fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is\\nattributable to expected synergies and monetization opportunities from gaining control over the Flexdrive platform (“developed technology” intangible asset) and\\ngaining greater flexibility in monetizing the fleet of owned and leased vehicles from the combined operations of the Company and Flexdrive. The acquisition is a\\ntaxable business combination for tax purposes and goodwill recognized in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.\\nThe fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $13.2 million with an estimated useful life of three years. The fair value of\\nthe developed technology was determined using the avoided cost approach. In the avoided cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the future after-tax costs\\nwhich are avoided (or reduced) as a result of owning (or having the rights to) the asset for three years after the Closing Date. Indications of value were developed by\\ndiscounting these benefits to their present value.\\nThe results of operations for the acquired business have been included on the consolidated statements of operations for the period subsequent to the Company\\'s\\nacquisition of Flexdrive. Flexdrive\\'s results of operations for periods prior to this acquisition were not material to the consolidated statements of operations and,\\naccordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented.\\n96\\n4. Divestitures\\nTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (“Woven Planet”)\\nOn July 13, 2021, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of\\ncertain assets related to the Company’s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to\\naccelerate the safety and commercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. The Company will receive, in total, approximately\\n$515\\xa0million in cash in connection with this transaction, with $165\\xa0million paid upfront and $350\\xa0million to be paid over a five-year period.\\nThe divestiture did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results, and therefore, does not qualify for\\nreporting as a discontinued operation. As the transaction included multiple elements, the Company had to estimate how much of the arrangement consideration was\\nattributable to the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division and how much was attributable to the commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft\\nrideshare and fleet data. The Company recognized a $119.3\\xa0million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division, which was based on\\nthe relative fair value of the Level 5 division, valued under the replacement cost method, and the estimated standalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data,\\nvalued using an adjusted market approach.. The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used to estimate the fair value of the Level 5 division assets\\nand the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the stand alone selling price of the rideshare data. The gain was\\nincluded in other income, net on the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. The commercial agreements for the utilization of\\nLyft rideshare and fleet data by Woven Planet is accounted for under ASC 606 and the Company recorded a deferred revenue liability of $42.5\\xa0million related to the\\nperformance obligations under these commercial agreements as part of the transaction at closing. The Company also derecognized $3.4\\xa0million in assets held for sale.\\n97\\n5.\\xa0Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\\nBalance as of December 31, 2020\\n$\\n182,687\\xa0\\nAdditions\\n—\\xa0\\nForeign currency translation and other adjustments\\n(3)\\nTransaction with Woven Planet\\n(2,168)\\nBalance as of December 31, 2021\\n$\\n180,516\\xa0\\nAdditions\\n81,108\\xa0\\nForeign currency translation and other adjustments\\n(42)\\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\\n$\\n261,582\\xa0\\nIntangible assets, net consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nWeighted-average\\nRemaining Useful\\nLife (Years)\\nGross Carrying\\nAmount\\nAccumulated\\nAmortization\\nNet\\xa0Carrying\\nAmount\\nDeveloped technology and patents\\n2.3\\n$\\n41,262\\xa0\\n$\\n20,424\\xa0\\n$\\n20,838\\xa0\\nContractual relationship – cities and user relationships\\n8.2\\n100,429\\xa0\\n45,059\\xa0\\n55,370\\xa0\\nTotal intangible assets\\n$\\n141,691\\xa0\\n$\\n65,483\\xa0\\n$\\n76,208\\xa0\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nWeighted-average\\nRemaining Useful\\nLife (Years)\\nGross Carrying\\nAmount\\nAccumulated\\nAmortization\\nNet\\xa0Carrying\\nAmount\\nDeveloped technology and patents\\n2.9\\n$\\n22,151\\xa0\\n$\\n12,643\\xa0\\n$\\n9,508\\xa0\\nContractual relationship – cities and user relationships\\n7.9\\n79,800\\xa0\\n38,543\\xa0\\n41,257\\xa0\\nTotal intangible assets\\n$\\n101,951\\xa0\\n$\\n51,186\\xa0\\n$\\n50,765\\xa0\\nAmortization expense was $18.4 million, $18.1\\xa0million and $29.2\\xa0million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, future amortization of intangible assets that will be recorded in cost of revenue and operating expenses is estimated as follows (in\\nthousands).\\nYear ended December 31:\\n2023\\n$\\n18,255\\xa0\\n2024\\n17,308\\xa0\\n2025\\n8,407\\xa0\\n2026\\n8,184\\xa0\\n2027\\n8,184\\xa0\\n\\xa0Thereafter\\n15,870\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Total remaining amortization\\n$\\n76,208\\xa0\\n98\\n6.

The term deposits are at cost, which approximates fair\\nvalue.\\nThe weighted-average remaining maturity of the Company’s investment portfolio was less than one year as of the periods presented. No\\xa0individual security\\nincurred continuous unrealized losses for greater than\\xa012 months.\\nThe Company purchases investment grade marketable debt securities which are rated by nationally recognized statistical credit rating organizations in\\naccordance with its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize the Company\\'s exposure to credit losses. As of December\\xa031, 2022, the credit-quality of the\\nCompany’s marketable available-for-sale debt securities had remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 was primarily related to the continued market volatility associated with market expectations of an aggressive pace of interest rate increases by the\\nFederal Reserve. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the\\ninvestments and it is not expected that the investments would be settled at a price less than their amortized cost basis. The Company does not intend to sell the\\ninvestments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The Company is\\nnot aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to change its quarterly assessment of credit losses for any marketable available-for-\\nsale debt security as of December\\xa031, 2022. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized on the\\nconsolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. No credit losses were recognized as of December\\xa031, 2022 for the Company’s marketable and non-\\nmarketable debt securities.\\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position for which no allowance for credit losses was\\nrecorded, aggregated by major security type (in thousands):\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n100\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nEstimated Fair Value\\nUnrealized Losses\\nCertificates of deposit\\n$\\n188,209\\xa0\\n$\\n(947)\\nCorporate bonds\\n76,417\\xa0\\n(121)\\nCommercial paper\\n718,771\\xa0\\n(2,528)\\nU.S. government securities\\n62,801\\xa0\\n(167)\\nTotal available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position\\n$\\n1,046,198\\xa0\\n$\\n(3,763)\\nProperty and Equipment, net\\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\\nDecember\\xa031,\\n2022\\n2021\\nBike fleet\\n$\\n179,330\\xa0\\n$\\n138,216\\xa0\\nLeasehold improvements\\n91,334\\xa0\\n100,252\\xa0\\nOwned vehicles\\n143,391\\xa0\\n150,443\\xa0\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\n32,887\\xa0\\n26,802\\xa0\\nComputer equipment and software\\n36,271\\xa0\\n19,103\\xa0\\nFurniture and fixtures\\n5,602\\xa0\\n5,110\\xa0\\nConstruction in progress\\n48,523\\xa0\\n25,270\\xa0\\n537,338\\xa0\\n465,196\\xa0\\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\\n(223,936)\\n(167,001)\\nProperty and equipment, net\\n$\\n313,402\\xa0\\n$\\n298,195\\xa0\\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment was $127.8 million, $115.3 million, and $121.0 million for the years ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\nAccrued and Other Current Liabilities\\nAccrued and other current liabilities consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\\nDecember\\xa031,\\n2022\\n2021\\nInsurance-related accruals\\n$\\n566,831\\xa0\\n$\\n336,340\\xa0\\nLegal accruals\\n458,209\\xa0\\n349,518\\xa0\\nRide-related accruals\\n181,138\\xa0\\n196,716\\xa0\\nLong-term debt, current\\n36,287\\xa0\\n56,264\\xa0\\nInsurance claims payable and related fees\\n53,280\\xa0\\n33,696\\xa0\\nDeferred gain related to the Reinsurance Transaction \\n2,357\\xa0\\n52,785\\xa0\\nOther\\n263,507\\xa0\\n239,107\\xa0\\nAccrued and other current liabilities\\n$\\n1,561,609\\xa0\\n$\\n1,264,426\\xa0\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nRefer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” above and the rest of this Note 6 “Supplemental Financial Information - Insurance Reserves” below for more information on this deferred\\ngain.\\n(1)\\n101\\nInsurance Reserves\\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the insurance reserve for the periods presented (in thousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nBalance at beginning of period\\n$\\n1,068,628\\xa0\\n$\\n987,064\\xa0\\n$\\n1,378,462\\xa0\\nAdditions\\n1,146,482\\xa0\\n772,321\\xa0\\n569,180\\xa0\\nDeductions\\n(797,760)\\n(690,757)\\n(960,578)\\nBalance at end of period\\n$\\n1,417,350\\xa0\\n$\\n1,068,628\\xa0\\n$\\n987,064\\xa0\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nAdditions to insurance reserves include $895.0\\xa0million, $527.1\\xa0million and $569.2\\xa0million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for changes in estimates resulting from\\nnew developments in prior period claims.

There was no such recoverable at the beginning of the period for the year ended December 31, 2020.\\nTransfer of Certain Legacy Auto Liability Insurance\\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, PVIC, entered into a Novation Agreement with Clarendon, and certain underwriting companies\\nof Zurich. Pursuant to the terms of the Novation, on the effective date March 31, 2020, the obligations of PVIC as reinsurer to Zurich for the Legacy Auto Liability,\\nwere assigned to, assumed by, and novated to Clarendon, for cash consideration of $465.0\\xa0million. As a result of the Novation, the Company’s obligations related to the\\nLegacy Auto Liability were fully extinguished and novated to Clarendon on March 31, 2020.\\nThe Company paid the $465.0\\xa0million cash consideration to Clarendon on April 3, 2020. The Company derecognized $407.9\\xa0million of insurance reserves\\nliabilities and recognized a loss of $64.7\\xa0million for the net cost of the Novation on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021,\\nwith $62.5\\xa0million in cost of revenue and $2.2\\xa0million in general and administrative expenses. In conjunction with the Novation, Clarendon and PVIC executed a\\nRetrocession Agreement, pursuant to which PVIC will reinsure Clarendon’s losses related to the Legacy Auto Liability in excess of an aggregate limit of\\n$816.0\\xa0million.\\nReinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liability Insurance\\nOn April 22, 2021, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. (“PVIC”), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance\\nAgreement (the “Reinsurance Agreement”) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (“DARAG”), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies,\\nbased on reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2\\xa0million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance\\nAgreement, PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3\\xa0million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018\\nto October 1, 2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5\\xa0million, for a premium of $271.5\\xa0million (“the Reinsurance Transaction”). The Reinsurance Agreement was on a\\nfunds withheld basis, meaning that funds are withheld by PVIC from the insurance premium owed to DARAG in order to pay future reinsurance claims on DARAG’s\\nbehalf. Upon consummation of the Reinsurance Transaction, a reinsurance recoverable of $251.3\\xa0million was established, and since a contractual right of offset exists,\\nthe reinsurance recoverable was netted against the funds withheld liability balance of $271.5\\xa0million for a $20.2\\xa0million net funds withheld liability balance included in\\naccrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the initial funds withheld balance of $271.5\\xa0million, additional coverage of certain\\nlegacy insurance liabilities was collateralized by a trust account established by DARAG for the benefit of PVIC, which was $75.0\\xa0million upon consummation. At the\\ninception of the Reinsurance Agreement, a loss of approximately $20.4\\xa0million for the total cost of the Reinsurance Transaction was recognized on the consolidated\\nstatement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with $20.2\\xa0million in cost of revenue and $0.2\\xa0million in general and administrative expenses. The\\nReinsurance Transaction does not discharge PVIC of its obligations to the policyholder. Management evaluated reinsurance counterparty credit risk and does not\\nconsider it to be material.\\nCommutation of the Reinsurance Agreement\\nOn June 21, 2022, PVIC and DARAG entered into a Commutation Agreement, which effectively commuted and settled the previous Reinsurance Agreement.\\nUnder the terms of the Commutation Agreement, DARAG released $89.3\\xa0million of assets held in trust to PVIC and the remaining balance of the funds withheld\\nliability of $90.3\\xa0million from the Reinsurance Transaction for a total consideration of $178.6\\xa0million.\\nIn addition, the Commutation Agreement caused a DARAG affiliate, DNA Insurance Company (“DNA”), to simultaneously enter into an Adverse\\nDevelopment Cover Reinsurance Agreement (“ADC”) with PVIC (the Commutation Agreement and the ADC\\n1\\n2\\n102\\nwill collectively be referred to as the “Commutation Transaction”). Under the terms of the ADC, DNA agreed to reinsure up to $20\\xa0million of the legacy insurance\\nliabilities contemplated in the Reinsurance Agreement for a premium of $1.0\\xa0million, which will be retained by PVIC on a funds withheld basis. DNA also has the\\noption to commute this agreement for $5.0\\xa0million prior to November 1, 2023, which may be offset by any premiums retained as funds withheld.\\nAs a result of the Commutation Transaction, the Company noted the following impacts on its financial statements:\\n•\\nThe Company recognized a $36.8\\xa0million gain in cost of revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2022, including amortization of a portion of the\\npreviously recognized deferred gain.\\n•\\nThe Company reduced its reinsurance recoverable by $247.4\\xa0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the balance of reinsurance recoverables was\\n$4.0\\xa0million, reflecting the ultimate amount it anticipates receiving from DNA as a result of this transaction. The reinsurance recoverable from DNA, net\\nof the funds withheld liability, is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\\n•\\nThe Company reduced the funds withheld liability balance by $90.3\\xa0million. As of December 31, 2022 the balance of the funds withheld liability was\\n$1.0\\xa0million, reflecting the premium retained by PVIC for the Adverse Development Cover.\\n•\\nThe Company amortized deferred gains related to losses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement by $105.7\\xa0million. As of December 31, 2022, the\\nCompany had $2.4\\xa0 million of deferred gains related to losses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement remaining following the Commutation\\nTransaction, which are included within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nOn February 8, 2023, PVIC and DNA entered into a Commutation and Mutual Release Agreement, whereby DNA agreed to exercise its option to fully settle\\nand commute the ADC. DNA commuted the ADC for $5.0\\xa0million consisting of a $4.0\\xa0million payment made to PVIC and the release of $1.0\\xa0million premium which\\nwas retained by PVIC as a funds withheld. As a result, PVIC recognized a gain of $3.4\\xa0million, comprised of $2.4\\xa0million amortization of the remaining deferred gain\\nand $1.0\\xa0million related to the release of the funds withheld. PVIC also reduced its reinsurance recoverable by $4.0\\xa0million related to the payment received.

Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated\\nstatements of operations.\\nIn June 2021 and June 2022, the Company received investments in a non-marketable equity security in a privately held company without a readily\\ndeterminable market value as part of licensing and data access agreements. The investment had an initial carrying value of $128.1\\xa0million as of June 30, 2022 which\\nwas categorized as Level 3. The Company did not have the ability to exercise significant influence over this privately-held company and had elected to measure this\\ninvestment as a non-marketable equity security and classified it in other investments on the consolidated balance sheet. The entire amount of the investment in the non-\\nmarketable equity security was impaired due to the announced winding down of the equity investee in October 2022. In addition to the impairment of this non-\\nmarketable equity security, an associated other asset was impaired, resulting in a total impairment of $135.7\\xa0million recorded to other income (expense), net on the\\nconsolidated statement of operations.\\nIn February 2022, the issuer of the Company\\'s $10.0\\xa0million investment in non-marketable equity securities in a privately held company was acquired by a\\npublicly-traded company. As a result of the acquisition in exchange for the securities in the privately-held entity, the Company received common stock of a publicly-\\ntraded entity with a value of $8.4\\xa0million upon receipt, with the remainder to be received in cash. These shares are classified as marketable equity securities in the table\\nabove and measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The shares are categorized as Level 1 and changes in fair value are recorded within other income (expense), net\\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\\nAt December\\xa031, 2022, there were $5.9\\xa0million of financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis within other investments on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets.\\nReconciliation of Level 3 Financial Assets and Liabilities\\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning balances of the Level 3 financial assets (in thousands):\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n105\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nBalance at beginning of period\\n$\\n80,411\\xa0\\n$\\n10,000\\xa0\\nAdditions\\n64,044\\xa0\\n70,260\\xa0\\nChange in fair value\\n(138,552)\\n151\\xa0\\nBalance at end of period\\n$\\n5,903\\xa0\\n$\\n80,411\\xa0\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nRelates to non-marketable equity securities included in other investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\\n(2)\\nIncludes a $128.1\\xa0million impairment related to an investment in the non-marketable equity security due to the announced winding down of the equity investee in the third quarter of 2022 and a\\n$10.0\\xa0million reduction in securities in a privately-held company related to an exchange of securities in a privately-held entity following its acquisition.

These leases are\\nclassified as operating leases. As of December\\xa031, 2022, the remaining lease terms vary from approximately two months to seven years. For certain leases the Company\\nhas options to extend the lease term for periods varying from two months to ten years. These renewal options are not considered in the remaining lease term unless it is\\nreasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset\\nand lease liability representing the fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance or\\nother services provided by the landlord, are accounted for as a component of the lease payment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.\\nFlexdrive Program\\nThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing\\ncompanies. These leases are classified as finance leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December\\xa031, 2022,\\nthe remaining lease terms vary between one month to four years. These leases generally do not contain any non-lease components and, as such, all payments due under\\nthese arrangements are allocated to the respective lease component.\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(1)\\n106\\nLease Position as of December\\xa031, 2022\\nThe table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands, except for remaining lease terms and\\npercentages):\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nOperating Leases\\nAssets\\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n135,213\\xa0\\n$\\n223,412\\xa0\\nLiabilities\\nOperating lease liabilities, current\\n$\\n45,803\\xa0\\n$\\n53,765\\xa0\\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current\\n176,356\\xa0\\n210,232\\xa0\\nTotal operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n222,159\\xa0\\n$\\n263,997\\xa0\\nFinance Leases\\nAssets\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n32,887\\xa0\\n$\\n26,802\\xa0\\nLiabilities\\nFinance lease liabilities, current\\n15,053\\xa0\\n13,556\\xa0\\nFinance lease liabilities, non-current\\n19,921\\xa0\\n14,242\\xa0\\nTotal finance lease liabilities\\n$\\n34,974\\xa0\\n$\\n27,798\\xa0\\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\\nOperating leases\\n5.1\\n5.6\\nFinance leases\\n2.5\\n2.2\\nWeighted-average discount rate\\nOperating leases\\n6.4\\xa0%\\n6.3\\xa0%\\nFinance leases\\n5.2\\xa0%\\n2.8\\xa0%\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company committed to a decision to exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to align with the Company’s anticipated operating needs and incurred impairment\\ncharges related to real estate operating right-of-use assets of $55.3\\xa0million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\n(2)\\nThis balance is included within property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets and is primarily related to leases acquired in the Flexdrive transaction.

The parties modified the aggregate commitment\\namounts and timing in January 2019, May 2020 and February 2022. Under the most recent amended arrangement, the Company committed to spend an aggregate of at\\nleast $350 million between February 2022 and January 2026, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the four contractual periods, on services with AWS. As\\nof December\\xa031, 2022, the Company has made payments of $104.6\\xa0million under the amended arrangement.\\nIn November 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Motivate, a New York headquartered bikeshare company. Over the approximately five years\\nfollowing the transaction, the Company committed to invest an aggregate of $100 million in the bikeshare program for the New York metro area. The Company also\\nassumed certain pre-existing contractual obligations to increase the bike fleets in other locations which are not considered to be material. As of December\\xa031, 2022, The\\nCompany has made investments in excess of $100.0\\xa0million under the arrangement.\\nIn May 2019, the Company entered into a noncancelable arrangement with the City of Chicago, with respect to the Divvy bike share program, under which the\\nCompany has an obligation to pay approximately $7.5 million per year to the City of Chicago through January 2028 and to spend a minimum of $50 million on capital\\nequipment for the bike share program through January 2028. As of December\\xa031, 2022, the Company has made payments totaling $29.2 million and capital equipment\\ninvestments totaling $37.0 million under the arrangement.\\nAs of\\xa0December\\xa031, 2022, the future minimum payments under the Company’s noncancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in thousands):\\n2023\\n$\\n108,519\\xa0\\n2024\\n88,800\\xa0\\n2025\\n94,477\\xa0\\n2026\\n9,396\\xa0\\n2027\\n24,240\\xa0\\nThereafter\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal future minimum payments\\n$\\n325,432\\xa0\\nLetters of Credit\\nThe Company maintains certain stand-by letters of credit from third-party financial institutions in the ordinary course of business to guarantee certain\\nperformance obligations related to leases, insurance policies and other various contractual arrangements.\\n109\\nNone of the outstanding letters of credit are collateralized by cash. As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of $55.1 million\\nand $53.1 million, respectively.\\nIndemnification\\nThe Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain business\\npartners, investors, contractors, parties to certain acquisition or divestiture transactions and the Company’s officers, directors and certain employees. The Company has\\nagreed to indemnify and defend the indemnified party’s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-\\nparty claims because of the Company’s activities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible\\nto determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique\\nfacts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the\\nindemnification provisions have not been material.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nThe Company is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations\\nin the ordinary course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, third parties and governmental entities (individually or as class actions) alleging, among\\nother things, various wage and expense related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company’s fees, rules or policies, that such fees,\\nrules or policies violate applicable law, or that the Company has not acted in conformity with such fees, rules or policies, as well as proceedings related to product\\nliability, antitrust, its acquisitions, securities issuances or business practices, or public disclosures about the business. In addition, the Company has been, and is\\ncurrently, named as a defendant in a number of litigation matters related to accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft\\nPlatform.\\nThe outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a material\\nloss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor is the Company able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could\\npotentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of the\\namount recorded.\\nIndependent Contractor Classification Matters\\nWith regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the\\nclassification of these drivers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that\\nwould apply to driver employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to change and divergent\\ninterpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.\\nFor example, Assembly Bill 5 (as codified in part at Cal. Labor Code sec. 2750.3) codified and extended an employment classification test set forth by the\\nCalifornia Supreme Court that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional\\nchallenges to the independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City\\nAttorneys of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective\\nplatforms as independent contractors in violation of Assembly Bill 5 and California’s Unfair Competition Law, and on August 5, 2020, the California Labor\\nCommissioner filed lawsuits against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective platforms as independent contractors,\\nseeking injunctive relief and material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and\\nUber to reclassify drivers in California as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that\\nprovided a framework for drivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect\\non December 16, 2020. On April 20, 2021, the court granted the parties’ joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On\\nMay 5, 2021, the California Labor Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company\\nand Uber. The coordination petition was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On December 19, 2022, the\\nCalifornia Attorney General’s and California Labor Commissioner\\'s cases were stayed in San Francisco Superior Court pending the appeal of a Superior Court order\\ndenying Lyft’s and Uber’s motions to compel arbitration. On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in the California Supreme Court against the State of\\nCalifornia alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Court denied review on February 3, 2021.\\nPlaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 11, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services (PADS) -- the coalition that\\nestablished and operated the official ballot measure committee that successfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in the Alameda lawsuit. On\\nAugust 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable. Both the California Attorney General\\nand PADS filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal. Oral arguments were heard on December 13, 2022 and a decision is expected soon. Separately, on July 14,\\n2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under\\nMassachusetts\\n110\\nlaw, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021. In September 2021,\\nthe Massachusetts Attorney General served Lyft and Uber with a motion for summary judgment on the issue of driver classification. In January 2022, before Lyft and\\nUber served their opposition briefs, the court continued the summary judgment motion to allow the parties more time to conduct discovery. Certain adverse outcomes of\\nsuch actions would have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including damages, penalties and potential\\nsuspension of operations in impacted jurisdictions, including California or Massachusetts. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any\\npossible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to\\nanother.\\nThe Company is currently involved in a number of putative class actions, thousands of individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\\npursuant to the Company\\'s Terms of Service to arbitration, matters brought, in whole or in part, as representative actions under California’s Private Attorney General\\nAct, Labor Code Section 2698, et seq., alleging that the Company misclassified drivers as independent contractors and other matters challenging the classification of\\ndrivers on the Company’s platform as independent contractors. The Company is currently defending allegations in a number of lawsuits that the Company has failed to\\nproperly classify drivers and provide those drivers with sick leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s chances of success on the\\nmerits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nThe Company disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. However, results of litigation,\\narbitration and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these driver claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a\\nmaterial impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have\\nan adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.\\nUnemployment Insurance Assessment\\nThe Company is involved in administrative audits with various state employment agencies, including audits related to driver classification, in California,\\nOregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Company believes that drivers are properly classified as independent contractors and plans\\nto vigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain. The Company accrues liabilities that\\nmay result from assessments by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and the expense is\\nrecorded to general and administrative expenses.\\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent\\ncontractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through March 31, 2018. The NJDOL issued an\\nassessment on June 4, 2019 and subsequently issued an updated assessment on March 31, 2021. The assessment was calculated through April 30, 2019, but only\\ncalculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2017. We filed a petition to challenge the assessment, and are awaiting a hearing.\\nThe Company has also submitted payment for the principal revised amount of the assessment to stop interest from accruing on this amount. While the ultimate\\nresolution of this matter is uncertain, the Company recorded this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022.\\nIndirect Taxes\\nThe Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arises\\nfrom disputes on tax treatment and tax rates applied to the sale of the Company’s services in these jurisdictions. The Company accrues indirect taxes that may result\\nfrom examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general\\nand administrative expenses.\\nPatent Litigation\\nThe Company is currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of\\nbusiness, the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to sell or license such property and/or\\nasserting infringement of such property. The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company’s\\nchances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nConsumer and Other Class Actions\\nThe Company is involved in a number of putative class actions alleging violations of consumer protection, civil rights, and other laws, such as the Telephone\\nConsumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA; antitrust and unfair competition laws such as California’s Cartwright Act, Unfair Practices Act and Unfair Competition\\nLaw; and the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, among others. In 2021, the Company received a favorable outcome in a case in the Northern District of\\nCalifornia alleging ADA violations with respect to Lyft’s wheelchair accessible vehicle (“WAV”) offerings in three Bay Area counties, Independent Living Resource\\nCenter San Francisco (“ILRC”) v. Lyft, Inc. After hearing evidence at a 5-day bench trial, the court ruled that plaintiffs\\n111\\nfailed their burden to prove that Lyft violates the ADA. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling. Lyft is facing a similar ADA lawsuit seeking injunctive and other relief\\nin the Southern District of New York, Lowell v. Lyft, Inc. On December 22, 2022, a magistrate judge recommended certification of three classes encompassing regions\\nwhere Lyft does not currently offer WAV service (Westchester County, NY; New York State except New York City; and all other “non-WAV” regions in the U.S.). Lyft\\nfiled objections to the magistrate judge’s recommendation and the district judge will issue a final decision, after which a trial date will be set. The Company disputes\\nany allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain\\nand any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nPersonal Injury and Other Safety Matters\\nIn the ordinary course of the Company’s business, various parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that the Company is liable for\\ndamages related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders, renters or third parties using or who have used services offered on the Lyft Platform, as well as\\nfrom third parties. The Company is currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders, renters and\\nthird parties. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses, disputes the allegations of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. There is\\nno pending or threatened claim that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company’s opinion, is likely to have a material impact on its\\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such\\naccidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, on January\\n17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple plaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating to alleged sexual assault\\nor harassment by drivers on the Lyft Platform, and a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding has been created before the Superior Court of California, County of San\\nFrancisco, where the claims of these and other plaintiffs are currently pending. Regardless of the outcome of these or other matters, litigation can have an adverse\\nimpact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors. Although the\\nCompany intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits, its chances of success on the merits are still uncertain as these matters are at various stages of litigation\\nand present a wide range of potential outcomes. The Company accrues for losses that may result from these matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\\n112\\nSecurities Litigation\\nBeginning in April 2019, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions have been filed in state and federal courts against the Company, its directors,\\ncertain of its officers, and certain of the underwriters named in the registration statement relating to the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) alleging violation of\\nsecurities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the IPO. The putative class actions have been consolidated into two putative\\nclass actions, one in California state court and the other in federal court. The derivative actions have also been consolidated into one action in federal court in\\nCalifornia.\\nOn July 1, 2020, the California state court sustained in part and overruled in part the Company\\'s demurrer to the consolidated complaint. The Company filed\\nits answer to this consolidated complaint on August 3, 2020. On February 26, 2021, the California state court struck additional allegations from the consolidated\\ncomplaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 17, 2021. The Company filed its demurrer and motion to strike the\\namended claim on April 13, 2021, and on July 16, 2021, the California state court overruled the demurrer but struck additional allegations from the consolidated\\ncomplaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend. The state court plaintiffs filed their renewed motion to certify a class action on June 24, 2021, and on January 25, 2022,\\nthe court denied plaintiffs’ motion without prejudice and stayed the case in light of the certified class action proceeding in federal court.\\nIn the California federal court class action, on May 14, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint and on September 8, 2020, the\\nfederal court granted in part and denied in part that motion. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on October 2, 2020, and the court certified the\\nclass action on August 20, 2021. On February 8, 2022, the parties informed the court they had reached an agreement in principle to settle the case on a class-wide basis,\\nand the plaintiff filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on June 16, 2022. On August 19, 2022, the putative lead plaintiffs in the\\nCalifornia state court action filed a motion to intervene in the California federal court class action for purposes of challenging the proposed class action settlement. In\\nresponse, the parties in the federal case submitted an amended stipulation of settlement on September 27, 2022 which now allows the state plaintiffs to opt-in to the\\nfederal class for purposes of objecting to the settlement, which rendered the motion to intervene moot. The federal parties’ motion for preliminary settlement approval\\nwas granted by the court on December 16, 2022. The court subsequently issued a scheduling order setting forth deadlines for notifying the class of the proposed\\nsettlement, for filing objections or opting out of the class, briefing schedules for the parties seeking final approval of the settlement and for seeking attorneys’ fees and\\ncosts, and setting a final fairness hearing for June 22, 2023.\\nIn the consolidated derivative action, at the parties’ joint request, the California federal court stayed the case on February 17, 2021.\\nAlthough the Company believes these lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them, the Company has accrued amounts related to\\nsuch matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general and administrative expenses.\\n10.

The 2025 Notes were offered and sold pursuant to a purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\\nand Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers (the \"Initial Purchasers\") in a private placement to qualified institutional\\nbuyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).\\nThe 2025 Notes mature on May 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the\\nCompany with interest payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020, at a rate of 1.50% per year. The\\nnet proceeds from this offering were approximately $733.2\\xa0million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and debt issuance costs.\\nThe initial conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is 26.0491 shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, which is\\nequivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $38.39 per share of the Class A common stock. The initial conversion price of the 2025 Notes represents a\\npremium of approximately 30% to the $29.53 per share closing price of the Company\\'s Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2020.\\nThe conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.\\nThe 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February\\n15, 2025, only under the following circumstances:\\n•\\nduring any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock, for at least 20\\ntrading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the\\nimmediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\\n•\\nduring the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in\\nthe Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last\\nreported sale price of the Company\\'s Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\\n•\\nif the Company calls such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding\\nthe redemption date; or\\n•\\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\\nOn or after February 15, 2025, the 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day\\nimmediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash,\\nshares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner\\nand subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture.\\nHolders of the 2025 Notes who convert their 2025 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as\\ndefined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a\\nfundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2025 Notes at a repurchase price equal\\nto 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into a liability and an equity component. At the date of issuance, the Company\\ndetermined the fair value of the liability component to be $558.3\\xa0million calculated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the borrowing rate for a\\nsimilar nonconvertible debt instrument. The equity component\\n (1)\\n114\\nrepresenting the conversion option was $189.2\\xa0million and was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2025 Notes.\\nThe equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The difference between the principal amount of the\\n2025 Notes and the liability component (\"debt discount\") was amortized to interest expense over the contractual term at an effective interest rate of 8.0%.\\nFollowing the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, the Company no longer bifurcates the 2025 Notes, but rather accounts for the conversion feature\\nas a single debt instrument. The difference between the carrying amount and face value of the liability results in a reduced liability component. Therefore, less interest\\nexpense is being recorded each period from January 1, 2022 to maturity and the equity component is now classified as debt, eliminating the subsequent amortization of\\nthe debt discount as interest expense. Accordingly, the Company recorded a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $140.0\\xa0million, net of tax, to\\nremove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features associated with the 2025 Notes and equity component associated with the issuance costs,\\nan increase of approximately $133.5\\xa0million in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes to reflect the full principal amount, net of issuance costs, and an increase to\\naccumulated deficit of approximately $6.5\\xa0million, net of tax in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with no impact to the Company’s consolidated statements of\\noperations.\\nDebt issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes totaled $14.3\\xa0million at inception were comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the Initial Purchasers\\nand third-party offering costs and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term. As of December 31, 2022, the\\nunamortized debt discount and debt issuance cost of the 2025 Notes was $6.9\\xa0million on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nThe last reported sale price of the Company\\'s Class A common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price of the 2025 Notes for at least 20 trading days\\nduring the 30 consecutive trading day period ended June 30, 2021. Accordingly, the 2025 Notes were convertible at the option of the holders at any time during the\\nquarter ended September 30, 2021. During the quarter ended September 30, 2021, holders of $2,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes elected early\\nconversion. The Company settled the conversion in cash resulting in an immaterial recognized loss on extinguishment of the liability and equity components during the\\nthird quarter of 2021.\\nDuring the quarter ended December\\xa031, 2022, the 2025 Notes did not meet any of the circumstances that would allow for a conversion.\\nBased on the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock on December\\xa031, 2022, the if-converted value of the 2025 Notes was $214.6\\nmillion, which would not exceed the outstanding principal amount.\\nThe net carrying amounts of the liability component of the 2025 Notes were as follows (in thousands):\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nPrincipal\\n$\\n747,498\\xa0\\nUnamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs\\n(6,889)\\nNet carrying amount of liability component\\n$\\n740,609\\xa0\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nThe Company adopted ASC 2020-06 on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach, which resulted in a $133.5\\xa0million increase to the carrying value of the convertible senior notes to\\nreflect the full principal amount of the convertible senior notes outstanding net of issuance costs at the time of adoption.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the total estimated fair values (which represents a Level 2 valuation) of the 2025 Notes were approximately $656.8 million. The\\nestimated fair value of the 2025 Notes was determined based on a market approach which was determined based on the actual bids and offers of the 2025 Notes in an\\nover-the-counter market on the last trading day of the period.\\nThe 2025 Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants, restrictions on dividends, incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or\\nrestrictions on the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company.\\nCapped Calls\\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with certain of\\nthe Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates (the \"option counterparties\") at a cost of approximately $132.7\\xa0million. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-\\ndilution adjustments, the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the 2025 Notes sold in the offering. By entering into the Capped Calls, the Company\\nexpects to reduce the potential dilution to its Class A common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2025 Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment\\nobligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2025 Notes the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock price exceeds the conversion price of\\nthe 2025 Notes. The cap price of the Capped Calls will initially be $73.83 per share, which represents a premium of 150% over the last reported sale price of the\\nCompany\\'s Class A common stock of $29.53 per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2020, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of\\nthe Capped Calls.\\n (1)\\n115\\nThe Capped Calls meet the criteria for classification in equity, are not remeasured each reporting period and included as a reduction to additional paid-in-\\ncapital within shareholders’ equity.\\nNon-revolving Loan\\nFollowing the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Loan and Security\\nAgreement dated March 11, 2019, as amended (the “Non-revolving Loan”) with a third-party lender. Pursuant to the term of the Non-revolving Loan as amended on\\nJune 21, 2021 and most recently on September 27, 2022, Flexdrive may request an extension of credit in the form of advances up to a maximum principal amount of\\n$130 million to purchase new Hyundai and Kia vehicles, or for other purposes, subject to approval by the lender. Advances paid or prepaid under the Non-revolving\\nLoan may not be reborrowed. Repayment terms for each advance include equal monthly installments sufficient to fully amortize the advances over the term, with an\\noption for the final installment to be greater than the others. The repayment term for each advance ranges from 24 months to 48 months. Interest is payable monthly in\\narrears at a fixed interest rate equal to the two-year U.S. Treasury note yield plus a spread of 3.4% for a 24-month term, the three-year U.S. Treasury note yield plus a\\nspread of 3.4% for a 36 month term, and the average of the three and five-year U.S. Treasury note yields plus a spread of 3.4% for a 48 month term. The Non-revolving\\nLoan is secured by all vehicles financed under the Non-revolving Loan.\\nThe Non-revolving Loan also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain\\nacquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events with\\nrespect to Flexdrive or the Company, all amounts due under the Non-revolving Loan may become immediately due and payable, among other remedies. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Non-revolving Loan in all material aspects. Further, the Company continued to\\nguarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed following the acquisition.\\nMaster Vehicle Loan\\nFollowing the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Master Vehicle\\nAcquisition Financing and Security Agreement, dated February 7, 2020 as amended (the “Master Vehicle Loan”) with a third-party lender. Pursuant to the term of the\\nMaster Vehicle Loan, Flexdrive may request loans up to a maximum principal amount of $50\\xa0million to purchase vehicles. Repayment terms for each loan include\\nequal monthly installments sufficient to amortize the loan over the term, with an option for the final installment to be greater than the others and is typically equal to the\\nresidual value guarantee the Company provides to the lender. The repayment term for each loan ranges from 12 months to 48 months. Interest is payable monthly in\\nadvance at a fixed interest rate equal to the three-year swap rate plus a spread of 2.10% on the date of the loan. Principal amounts outstanding related to the Master\\nVehicle Loan may be fully or partially prepaid at the option of Flexdrive and must be prepaid under certain circumstances. However, if a loan is terminated for any\\nreason prior to the last day of the minimum loan term Flexdrive will be obligated to pay to the lender, an early termination fee in an amount which is equal to the\\ninterest which would otherwise be payable by Flexdrive to lender for the remainder of the minimum loan term for that loan. The Master Vehicle Loan is secured by all\\nvehicles financed under the Master Vehicle Loan as well as certain amounts held in escrow for the benefit of the lender. Amounts held in escrow are recorded as\\nrestricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe Master Vehicle Loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain\\nacquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events with\\nrespect to Flexdrive or the Company, all amounts due under the Master Vehicle Loan may become immediately due and payable, among other remedies. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, Flexdrive was in compliance with all covenants related to the Master Vehicle Loan in all material respects. Further, the Company continued to\\nguarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed following the acquisition.\\nThe fair values of the Non-revolving Loan and Master Vehicle Loan were $24.9 million and $72.3 million, respectively, as of December\\xa031, 2022 and were\\ndetermined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which are considered a Level 2 valuation input. As of December 31, 2022, the Company made\\nrepayments of $67.6 million on these loans.\\nMaturities of long-term debt outstanding, including current maturities, as of December\\xa031, 2022 were as follows (in thousands):\\n2023\\n$\\n36,290\\xa0\\n2024\\n30,920\\xa0\\n2025\\n772,284\\xa0\\n2026\\n—\\xa0\\n2027\\n—\\xa0\\nThereafter\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal long-term debt outstanding\\n$\\n839,494\\xa0\\n116\\nVehicle Procurement Agreement\\nFollowing the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Vehicle Procurement\\nAgreement (“VPA”), as amended, with a third-party (“the Procurement Provider”). Procurement services under the VPA include purchasing and upfitting certain motor\\nvehicles as specified by Flexdrive, interim financing, providing certain fleet management services, including without limitation vehicle titling, registration and tracking\\nservices on behalf of Flexdrive. Pursuant to the terms of the VPA, Flexdrive will make the applicable payments to the Procurement Provider for the procurement\\nservices either directly or through an advance made by the Master Vehicle Loan or the Non-revolving Loan. Interest on interim financing is payable on any unpaid\\namount based on either the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least seven of the ten largest US banks or LIBOR of interest for one month periods as set forth in\\nThe Wall Street Journal plus a spread of 3.00%, as applicable.\\nThe Procurement Provider has a security interest in vehicles purchased until the full specified payment has been indefeasibly paid. The VPA contains\\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants restricting certain activities by Flexdrive. As of December\\xa031, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants\\nof the VPA. As of December\\xa031, 2022, the outstanding borrowings from the interim financing under the VPA was $3.0 million.\\nOn March 11, 2019, the Procurement Provider entered into a $95.0\\xa0million revolving credit facility with a third-party lender to finance the acquisition of motor\\nvehicles on behalf of Flexdrive under the VPA.

Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2022 with the exception of tax years\\nbeginning before 2018 in Canada and 2021 in the United Kingdom.\\nThe Company has not provided foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,\\nbecause it intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability\\nwill be immaterial, due to the participation exemption put in place by the 2017 Tax Act.\\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued\\ninterest and penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and\\npenalties in its consolidated statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. The Company has no material unrecognized\\ntax benefits as of December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\\n13.\\xa0Net Loss Per Share\\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less\\nshares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period.\\nFor purposes of this calculation, stock options, RSUs, PSUs, the 2025 Notes and stock purchase rights granted under the Company’s ESPP are considered to be\\ncommon stock equivalents but are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share when including them has an anti-dilutive effect. Basic and diluted net loss\\nper share are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.\\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nNet loss\\n$\\n(1,584,511)\\n$\\n(1,062,144)\\n$\\n(1,752,857)\\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share, basic and diluted\\n354,731\\xa0\\n334,724\\xa0\\n312,175\\xa0\\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted\\n$\\n(4.47)\\n$\\n(3.17)\\n$\\n(5.61)\\nThe following potentially dilutive outstanding shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because\\nincluding them would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied by\\nthe end of the period (in thousands):\\nAs of December\\xa031,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n2025 Notes\\n19,471\\xa0\\n19,471\\xa0\\n19,471\\xa0\\nRestricted stock units\\n20,542\\xa0\\n16,285\\xa0\\n33,428\\xa0\\nPerformance based restricted stock units\\n1,773\\xa0\\n831\\xa0\\n175\\xa0\\nStock options\\n993\\xa0\\n1,105\\xa0\\n1,919\\xa0\\nESPP\\n307\\xa0\\n115\\xa0\\n89\\xa0\\nTotal\\n43,086\\xa0\\n37,807\\xa0\\n55,082\\xa0\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into Capped Calls, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, as their\\neffect would have been anti-dilutive. The Capped Calls are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the Company\\'s Class A common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2025 Notes is settled\\nin cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2025 Notes the Company\\'s Class A common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2025\\nNotes.\\n(1)\\n123\\n14.\\xa0Related Party Transactions\\nThe Company\\'s transactions with related parties were immaterial for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\\n15.\\xa0401(k) Plan\\nThe Company adopted a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section\\xa0401 of the IRC. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating\\nemployees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company does not make contributions for employees.\\n16.\\xa0Restructuring\\nNovember 2022 Restructuring Plan\\nIn November 2022, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows. As a result of the restructuring plan, in\\nthe fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded $29.5\\xa0 million in employee severance and other employee costs costs and $9.5\\xa0 million in net stock-based\\ncompensation expense related to equity compensation for employees impacted by the plan of termination.\\nThe Company’s plan of termination also included restructuring charges related to a decision to exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to align with\\nthe Company’s anticipated operating needs. The Company reassessed its real estate asset groups and estimated the fair value of the space to be subleased using current\\nmarket conditions. Where the carrying value of the individual asset groups exceeded their fair value, an impairment charge was recognized for the difference. During\\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, this included $55.3\\xa0 million in impairment charges related to real estate operating lease right-of-use assets, $23.9\\xa0 million in\\naccelerated depreciation of certain fixed assets and $2.1\\xa0million in write-off fixed assets not yet placed into service. As a result of the above, the Company incurred net\\nrestructuring charges of $120.3\\xa0million in the year ended December 31, 2022.\\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company expects to finalize the exit of certain leases as part of the plan of termination and the Company completed a\\ntransaction for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company’s first party vehicle services business. As a result, in the first quarter of 2023, the Company\\nexpects to record lease termination penalties and impairment charges related to the cease use of certain facilities to real estate operating lease right-of-use assets. The\\nremaining employee related charges, which include employee severance, benefits and stock-based compensation, will not be material in the first quarter of 2023.\\nThe following table summarizes the above restructuring related charges (benefits) by line item within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations\\nwhere they were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nSeverance and Other\\nEmployee Costs\\nRight-of-Use Asset\\nImpairments and Other\\nCosts\\nAccelerated Depreciation\\nTotal\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n182\\xa0 $\\n1,612\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0 $\\n1,794\\xa0\\nOperation and support\\n(31)\\n5,173\\xa0\\n4,851\\xa0\\n8,680\\xa0\\n18,673\\xa0\\nResearch and development\\n3,818\\xa0\\n9,706\\xa0\\n15,393\\xa0\\n36\\xa0\\n28,953\\xa0\\nSales and marketing\\n458\\xa0\\n3,123\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n3,581\\xa0\\nGeneral and administrative\\n5,082\\xa0\\n9,861\\xa0\\n37,120\\xa0\\n15,192\\xa0\\n67,255\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n9,509\\xa0 $\\n29,475\\xa0 $\\n57,364\\xa0 $\\n23,908\\xa0 $\\n120,256\\xa0\\nCash paid for restructuring in 2022 was related to severance and other employee costs which include cash severance expense and other termination benefits.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, there were $1.6\\xa0million in restructuring-related liabilities. As of December 31, 2021, there were no restructuring-related liabilities.\\nNovember 2020 Restructuring Plan\\nIn November 2020, the Company announced an additional restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing\\neconomic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Company’s business. As a result of the restructuring plan, which was substantially\\ncompleted in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a severance and other employee costs of $1.5 million. This was offset by a stock based compensation\\nbenefit of $0.1\\xa0 million due to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards for employees who were terminated. As a result, the Company recognized net\\nrestructuring costs of $1.4\\xa0million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\\nApril 2020 Restructuring Plan\\nIn April 2020, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges\\nresulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Company’s business. As a result of the restructuring plan, which was substantially completed in the\\nsecond quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a stock-based compensation benefit related to the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation\\nexpenses for unvested stock awards,\\n124\\nprimarily related to RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement on March 28, 2019 using the accelerated attribution method, of\\n$72.7\\xa0million. This was offset by a $22.9\\xa0million charge related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards for employees who were terminated, resulting in a\\nnet stock-based compensation benefit of $49.8\\xa0million. Additionally, the Company recognized other restructuring charges including severance and other employee costs\\nof $32.1\\xa0million as well as lease termination and other restructuring charges of $3.1\\xa0million. As a result of the above, the Company recognized a net restructuring\\nbenefit of $14.5\\xa0million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\\nThe following table summarizes the above restructuring related charges (benefits) by line item within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations\\nwhere they were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nBenefit\\nSeverance and Other\\nEmployee Costs\\nLease Termination and\\nOther Costs\\nTotal\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n(4,237) $\\n2,010\\xa0 $\\n1,529\\xa0 $\\n(698)\\nOperation and support\\n(2,830)\\n8,281\\xa0\\n1,060\\xa0\\n6,511\\xa0\\nResearch and development\\n(37,082)\\n11,706\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n(25,376)\\nSales and marketing\\n(1,626)\\n3,071\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n1,445\\xa0\\nGeneral and administrative\\n(4,031)\\n7,062\\xa0\\n539\\xa0\\n3,570\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n(49,806) $\\n32,130\\xa0 $\\n3,128\\xa0 $\\n(14,548)\\n17.\\xa0Variable Interest Entities\\nAs part of its acquisition of PBSC, the Company acquired several joint ventures (“JVs”) which were deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in\\naccordance with ASC 810 Consolidation on the acquisition date. The Company determined that PBSC is the primary beneficiary of one of the acquired VIEs, in which\\nit owns an 80% equity interest, as PBSC has the power to direct the majority of the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, the\\nobligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits. As PBSC is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interest, revenues and\\noperating results are included in the consolidated financial statements. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, PBSC entered into another joint venture deemed\\nto be a VIE which was accounted for under the equity method which was immaterial.\\nThe acquisition date fair value of the VIEs acquired as part of the PBSC acquisition was $22.2\\xa0million, which exceeds the carrying value and is recorded\\nwithin other investments in the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum potential financial statement loss the Company would incur if these VIEs were to default on\\nall their obligations would be the loss of the carrying value of these investments as well as any current or future investments, if any, PBSC were to make which was\\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2022.\\nThe Company has determined that PBSC does not direct the activities that would significantly affect the economic performance of these VIEs. Therefore, the\\nCompany is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. As a result, the Company accounts for its investment in these VIEs under the equity method, and they are not\\nconsolidated into the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the reported profits or losses of these\\nVIEs in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to its investment in VIEs in the consolidated balance sheets. The\\nprofits and losses of these unconsolidated VIEs were not material to the consolidated statements of operations for the period ended December 31, 2022.\\n125\\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\\nNone.\\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of\\nthe period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that,\\nas of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)\\nunder the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial\\nreporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\\nIn accordance with guidance issued by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their first\\nassessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition. Based on those guidelines, management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the\\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting excluded PBSC Urban Solutions, Inc. (“PBSC”), which the Company acquired in the second quarter of 2022. See\\nNote 3 “Acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company’s acquisition of PBSC, our wholly-owned subsidiary. We\\nhave included the financial results of this acquisition in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. PBSC represented approximately 2% of\\nconsolidated total assets as of December 31, 2022, and 1% of consolidated total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\\nOur management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of\\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\\neffective as of December 31, 2022.\\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of\\nthe Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our\\ninternal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,\\nnot absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide\\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-\\nmaking can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some\\npersons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain\\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future\\nconditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due\\nto inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\\nItem 9B. Other Information.\\nNone.\\n126\\nItem 9C.

(“us”, “our,” “we”, or the “Company”) is a summary. We have adopted an amended and restated certificate of\\nincorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and this description summarizes the provisions that are included in such documents. Because it is only a summary, it\\ndoes not contain all the information that may be important to you. For a complete description of the matters set forth in this Exhibit 4.2, you should refer to our\\namended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, each previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and\\nincorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.2 is a part, and to the applicable provisions of Delaware law. Our\\nauthorized capital stock consists of 19,100,000,000 shares of capital stock, $0.00001 par value per share, of which:\\n•\\n18,000,000,000 shares are designated as Class A common stock;\\n•\\n100,000,000 shares are designated as Class B common stock; and\\n•\\n1,000,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.\\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval except as required by the listing\\nstandards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, to issue additional shares of our Class A common stock. Until the final conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B\\ncommon stock pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or the Final Conversion Date, any issuance of additional shares of Class B\\ncommon stock requires the approval of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock voting as a separate class.\\nCommon Stock\\nWe have two classes of authorized common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B\\ncommon stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion.\\nDividend Rights\\nSubject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of\\nfunds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and then only at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors\\nmay determine.\\nVoting Rights\\nHolders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and holders of our Class B common\\nstock are entitled to 20 votes for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. The holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common\\nstock vote together as a single class, unless otherwise required by law. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, approval of the holders of a\\nmajority of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock is required to increase the number of authorized shares of our Class B common stock. In addition,\\nDelaware law could require either holders of our Class A common stock or our Class B common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following\\ncircumstances:\\n•\\nif we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase or decrease the par value of a class of stock, then that class would\\nbe required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment; and\\n•\\nif we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences or special rights\\nof a class of stock in a manner that affected its holders adversely, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment.\\nUntil the Final Conversion Date, approval of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock voting as a separate class will be required to:\\n•\\namend or modify any provision of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation inconsistent with, or otherwise alter, any provision of the amended and\\nrestated certificate of incorporation to modify the voting, conversion or other rights, powers, preferences, privileges or restrictions of our Class B common\\nstock;\\n•\\nreclassify any outstanding shares of Class A common stock into shares having rights as to dividends or liquidation that are senior to the Class B common stock\\nor the right to have more than one vote for each share thereof;\\n•\\nissue any shares of Class B common stock, including by dividend, distribution or otherwise; or\\n•\\nauthorize, or issue any shares of, any class or series of our capital stock having the right to more than one vote for each share thereof.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving\\nstaggered three-year terms. Only the directors in one class will be subject to election by a plurality of the votes cast at each annual meeting of stockholders, with the\\ndirectors in the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. Stockholders do not have the ability to cumulate votes for the election of\\ndirectors.\\nNo Preemptive or Similar Rights\\nOur common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights, and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.\\nRight to Receive Liquidation Distributions\\nIf we become subject to a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders would be distributable ratably among\\nthe holders of our common stock and any participating preferred stock outstanding at that time, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the\\npreferential rights of and the payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\\nConversion of Class B Common Stock\\nEach share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock. Shares of Class B common stock\\nwill automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock upon sale or transfer except for certain transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of\\nincorporation, including estate planning or charitable transfers where sole dispositive power and exclusive voting control with respect to the shares of Class B common\\nstock are retained by the transferring holder or such transferring holder’s spouse. In addition, each outstanding share of Class B common stock held by a stockholder\\nwho is a natural person, or held by the permitted entities and permitted transferees of such natural person (as described in our amended and restated certificate of\\nincorporation), will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon the death of such natural person. In the event of the death or permanent and\\ntotal disability of either Logan Green or John Zimmer, each referred to herein as a Co-Founder, shares of Class B common stock held by such Co-Founder, his\\npermitted entities or permitted transferees will convert to Class A common stock, provided that the conversion will be deferred for nine months, or up to 18 months if\\napproved by a majority of our independent directors, following his death or permanent and total disability and provided further, that to the extent the other Co-Founder\\nhas or shares voting control over such shares, the shares of Class B common stock will be treated as held of record by the Co-Founder that has or shares voting control.\\nTransfers between our Co-Founders are permitted transfers and will not result in conversion of the shares of Class B common stock that are transferred and such shares\\nof Class B common stock will be treated as held of record by the transferee Co-Founder. With respect to any shares of Class B common stock over which the spouse of\\na Co-Founder has voting control, such shares of Class B common stock will convert to shares of Class A common stock upon divorce if the spouse retains voting\\ncontrol.\\nEach share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of\\nthe holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more\\nthan 180 days following the date on which the shares of Class B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent\\nless than 20% of the Class B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permitted entities as of immediately following the Company’s initial public offering, or\\nIPO, or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last to die or become disabled of our Co-Founders, or such later date not to exceed a total period of 18\\nmonths after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.\\nPreferred Stock\\nOur board of directors has the authority, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time\\nthe number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and any of its qualifications,\\nlimitations or restrictions, in each case without further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of\\nany series of preferred stock, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of\\ndirectors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our\\ncommon stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other\\nthings, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock and\\nthe voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. We have no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.\\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\\nCertain provisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, which are summarized below, may\\nhave the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another person from acquiring control of us. They are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to\\nacquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with an\\nunfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us because negotiation of these proposals could result in an\\nimprovement of their terms.\\nDelaware Law\\nWe are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a public Delaware corporation from\\nengaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\\ninterested stockholder, unless:\\n•\\nthe business combination or transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder was approved by the board of directors prior to\\nthe time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder;\\n•\\nupon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of\\nthe voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by directors who are also officers of the\\ncorporation and shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held\\nsubject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\\n•\\nat or subsequent to the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the business combination was approved by the board of directors and authorized\\nat an annual or special meeting of the stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock\\nwhich is not owned by the interested stockholder.\\nIn general, Section 203 defines a “business combination” to include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in financial benefit to a stockholder and an\\n“interested stockholder” as a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding\\nvoting stock. These provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing changes in control of our company.\\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws Provisions\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that could deter hostile takeovers or delay\\nor prevent changes in control of our board of directors or management team, including the following:\\nDual Class Stock\\nAs described above in “Common Stock-Voting Rights,”, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure, which\\nprovides our Co-Founders, individually or together, with\\nsignificant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other\\nsale of our company or its assets.\\nClassified Board\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors, each of which holds office for a\\nthree-year term. In addition, directors may only be removed from the board of directors for cause. The existence of a classified board could delay a potential acquirer\\nfrom obtaining majority control of our board of directors, and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential acquirer.\\nBoard of Directors Vacancies\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant directorships, including\\nnewly created seats. In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors is permitted to be set only by a resolution adopted by a majority vote of our\\nentire board of directors. These provisions would prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and then gaining control of our board of\\ndirectors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees. This makes it more difficult to change the composition of our board of directors and promotes\\ncontinuity of management.\\nStockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our stockholders may not take action by written consent, but may only take action at annual or\\nspecial meetings of our stockholders. As a result, a holder controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to amend our amended and restated bylaws or\\nremove directors without holding a meeting of our stockholders called in accordance with our amended and restated bylaws. Our amended and restated bylaws further\\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\\nExecutive Officer or our President, thus prohibiting a stockholder from calling a special meeting. These provisions might delay the ability of our stockholders to force\\nconsideration of a proposal or for stockholders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors.\\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations\\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders or to\\nnominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws also specify certain requirements regarding the\\nform and content of a stockholder’s notice. These provisions might preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from\\nmaking nominations for directors at our annual meeting of stockholders if the proper procedures are not followed. We expect that these provisions may also discourage\\nor deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our\\ncompany.\\nNo Cumulative Voting\\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law provides that stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless a corporation’s certificate of\\nincorporation provides otherwise. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting.\\nAmendment of Charter and Bylaws Provisions\\nAmendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding voting power of our common stock. Our\\namended and restated bylaws provide that approval of stockholders holding two-thirds of our outstanding voting power voting as a single class is required for\\nstockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws.\\nIssuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock\\nOur board of directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and\\npreferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock would\\nenable our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other\\nmeans.\\nExclusive Forum\\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and\\nexclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our\\ndirectors, stockholders, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation\\nLaw or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of\\nChancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of\\nDelaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an\\nalternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause\\nof action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), against any person in connection with any offering of the our securities, including,\\nwithout limitation and for the avoidance of doubt, any auditor, underwriter, expert, control person or other defendant. Any person or entity purchasing, holding or\\notherwise acquiring any interest in our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. This provision is enforceable by any party to a\\ncomplaint covered by this provision. For avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this provision applies to any action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by\\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto.\\nLimitation of Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by\\nthe Delaware General Corporation Law. Consequently, our directors are not personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of\\nfiduciary duties as directors, except liability for the following:\\n•\\nany breach of their duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders;\\n•\\nany act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\\n•\\nunlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or\\n•\\nany transaction from which they derived an improper personal benefit.\\nAny amendment to, or repeal of, these provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of these provisions in respect of any act, omission or claim that occurred or\\narose prior to that amendment or repeal. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to provide for further limitations on the personal liability of directors of\\ncorporations, then the personal liability of our directors will be further limited to the greatest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law.\\nIn addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any person who is or was a party or is threatened to\\nbe made a party to any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that they are or were one of our directors or officers or is or was serving at our request as a\\ndirector or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that we may indemnify to the\\nfullest extent permitted by law any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that they are\\nor were one of our employees or agents or is or was serving at our request as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other\\nenterprise. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that we must advance expenses incurred by or on behalf of a director or officer in advance of the final\\ndisposition of any action or proceeding, subject to limited exceptions.\\nFurther, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers that may be broader than the specific indemnification\\nprovisions contained in the Delaware General Corporation Law. These indemnification agreements require us, among other things, to indemnify our directors and\\nexecutive officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service. These indemnification agreements also require us to advance all expenses\\nincurred by the directors and executive officers in investigating or defending any such action, suit or proceeding. We believe that these agreements are necessary to\\nattract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and executive officers.\\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions that are included in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and in\\nindemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and executive officers may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our\\ndirectors and executive officers for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and executive\\nofficers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other\\nstockholders. Further, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and\\nexecutive officers as required by these indemnification provisions.\\nWe have obtained insurance policies under which, subject to the limitations of the policies, coverage is provided to our directors and executive officers against loss\\narising from claims made by reason of breach of fiduciary duty or other wrongful acts as a director or executive officer, including claims relating to public securities\\nmatters, and to us with respect to payments that may be made by us to these directors and executive officers pursuant to our indemnification obligations or otherwise as\\na matter of law.\\nCertain of our non-employee directors may, through their relationships with their employers, be insured or indemnified against certain liabilities incurred in their\\ncapacity as members of our board of directors.\\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling our company pursuant to the\\nforegoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is\\ntherefore unenforceable.\\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The transfer agent and\\nregistrar’s address is 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219.\\nListing\\nOur Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “LYFT”.\\nExhibit 10.4\\nLYFT, INC.\\n2019 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN\\n(as amended and restated July 26, 2021) (the “First Amendment Effective Date”), as further amended and restated July 18, 2022 (the “Second Amendment Effective\\nDate”)\\n1.\\nPurpose. The purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of the Company and its Designated Companies with an opportunity to purchase Common\\nStock through accumulated Contributions. The Company intends for the Plan to have two components: a component that is intended to qualify as an “employee stock\\npurchase plan” under Section 423 of the Code (the “423\\xa0Component”) and a component that is not intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under\\nSection 423 of the Code (the “Non-423 Component”). The provisions of the 423\\xa0 Component, accordingly, will be construed so as to extend and limit Plan\\nparticipation in a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis consistent with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code.

For the avoidance of doubt, increases in the percentage of total voting power owned by the Founders and/or their\\nPermitted Entities resulting solely from a decrease in the number of shares of stock of the Company outstanding shall not constitute an acquisition that creates a Change\\nin Control under this subsection (i); or\\n(ii) Change in Effective Control of the Company.

In the case of the Non-423 Component, Eligible Employees may be excluded from\\nparticipation in the Plan or an Offering if the Administrator determines that participation of such Eligible Employees is not advisable or practicable.\\n(d)\\nLimitations. Any provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no Eligible Employee will be granted an option under the Plan (i) to\\nthe extent that, immediately after the grant, such Eligible Employee (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to such Eligible Employee pursuant to\\nSection 424(d) of the Code) would own capital stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company and/or hold outstanding options to purchase such\\nstock possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of the capital stock of the Company or of any Parent or Subsidiary\\nof the Company, or (ii) to the extent that his or her rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans (as defined in Section 423 of the Code) of the\\nCompany or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company accrues at a rate, which exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) (or, in the case of Offering Periods\\nbeginning prior to the First Amendment Effective Date, twenty thousand dollars ($20,000)) worth of stock (determined at the Fair Market Value of the stock at the time\\nsuch option is granted) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time, as determined in accordance with Section 423 of the Code and the\\nregulations thereunder.\\n4.\\nOffering Periods. The Plan will be implemented by consecutive, overlapping Offering Periods with a new Offering Period commencing on the first\\nTrading Day on or after May 15 and November 15 each year, or on such other dates as the Administrator will determine. The duration and timing of Offering Periods\\nmay be changed pursuant to Sections\\xa020 and 30. The Administrator will have the power to change the duration of Offering Periods (including the commencement\\ndates thereof) with respect to future Offerings without stockholder approval if such change is announced prior to the scheduled beginning of the first Offering Period\\nto be affected thereafter; provided, however, that no Offering Period may last more than twenty-seven (27) months.\\n5.\\nParticipation. An Eligible Employee may participate in the Plan pursuant to Section 3(b) by (i) submitting to the Company’s stock administration\\noffice (or its designee) a properly completed subscription agreement authorizing Contributions in the form provided by the Administrator for such purpose (which may\\nbe similar to the form attached hereto as Exhibit A) or (ii)\\xa0following an electronic or other enrollment procedure determined by the Administrator, in either case on or\\nbefore a date determined by the Administrator prior to an applicable Enrollment Date.\\n6\\n6.\\nContributions.\\n(a)\\nAt the time a Participant enrolls in the Plan pursuant to Section 5, he or she will elect to have Contributions (in the form of payroll\\ndeductions or otherwise, to the extent permitted by the Administrator) made on each pay day during the Offering Period in an amount not exceeding fifteen percent\\n(15%) of the Compensation that he or she receives on the pay day (for illustrative purposes, should a pay day occur on an Exercise Date, a Participant will have any\\nContributions made on such day applied to his or her account under the then-current Purchase Period or Offering Period). The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may\\npermit all Participants in a specified Offering to contribute amounts to the Plan through payment by cash, check or other means set forth in the subscription agreement\\nprior to each Exercise Date of each Purchase Period. A Participant’s subscription agreement will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods unless terminated as\\nprovided in Section 10 hereof.\\n(b)\\nIn the event Contributions are made in the form of payroll deductions, such payroll deductions for a Participant will commence on the first\\npay day following the Enrollment Date and will end on the last pay day on or prior to the last Exercise Date of such Offering Period to which such authorization is\\napplicable, unless sooner terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10 hereof; provided, however, that for the first Offering Period, payroll deductions will\\ncommence on the first pay day on or following the end of the Enrollment Window.\\n(c)\\nAll Contributions made for a Participant will be credited to his or her account under the Plan and Contributions will be made in whole\\npercentages of his or her Compensation only. A Participant may not make any additional payments into such account.\\n(d)\\nA Participant may discontinue his or her participation in the Plan as provided under Section 10. Unless otherwise determined by the\\nAdministrator, during a Purchase Period, a Participant may not increase the rate of his or her Contributions and may only decrease the rate of his or her Contributions\\none (1) time. Any such decrease during a Purchase Period requires the Participant (i) properly complete and submit to the Company’s stock administration office (or its\\ndesignee) a new subscription agreement authorizing the change in Contribution rate in the form provided by the Administrator for such purpose or (ii) following an\\nelectronic or other procedure prescribed by the Administrator, in either case on or before a date determined by the Administrator prior to an applicable Exercise Date. If\\na Participant has not followed such procedures to change the rate of Contributions, the rate of his or her Contributions will continue at the originally elected rate\\nthroughout the Purchase Period and future Offering Periods and Purchase Periods (unless the Participant’s participation is terminated as provided in Sections 10 or 11).\\nThe Administrator may, in its sole discretion, amend the nature and/or number of Contribution rate changes that may be made by Participants during any Offering\\nPeriod or Purchase Period and may establish other conditions or limitations as it deems appropriate for Plan administration. Any change in the rate of Contributions\\nmade pursuant to this Section 6(d) will be effective as of the first (1 ) full payroll period following five (5) business days after the date on which the change is made by\\nthe Participant (unless the Administrator, in its sole discretion, elects to process a given change in payroll deduction rate more quickly).\\n(e)\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section\\xa0 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(d), a Participant’s\\nContributions may be decreased to zero percent (0%) at any time during a Purchase Period. Subject to Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(d) hereof,\\nContributions will recommence at the rate originally elected by the Participant effective as of the beginning of the first Purchase Period scheduled to end in the\\nfollowing calendar year, unless terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10.\\n(f)\\nNotwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Plan, the Administrator may allow Participants to participate in the Plan via cash\\ncontributions instead of payroll deductions if (i) payroll deductions are not\\nst\\n7\\npermitted under applicable local law, (ii) the Administrator determines that cash contributions are permissible under Section 423 of the Code; or (iii) the Participants are\\nparticipating in the Non-423 Component.\\n(g)\\nAt the time the option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time some or all of the Common Stock issued under the Plan is disposed of\\n(or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs), the Participant must make adequate provision for the Company’s or Employer’s federal, state, local or\\nany other tax liability payable to any authority including taxes imposed by jurisdictions outside of the U.S., national insurance, social security or other tax withholding\\nobligations, if any, which arise upon the exercise of the option or the disposition of the Common Stock (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan\\noccurs). At any time, the Company or the Employer may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from the Participant’s compensation the amount necessary for the\\nCompany or the Employer to meet applicable withholding obligations, including any withholding required to make available to the Company or the Employer any tax\\ndeductions or benefits attributable to sale or early disposition of Common Stock by the Eligible Employee. In addition, the Company or the Employer may, but will not\\nbe obligated to, withhold from the proceeds of the sale of Common Stock or any other method of withholding the Company or the Employer deems appropriate to the\\nextent permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section\\xa01.423-2(f).\\n7.\\nGrant of Option. On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period, each Eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period will be granted an\\noption to purchase on each Exercise Date during such Offering Period (at the applicable Purchase Price) up to a number of shares of Common Stock determined by\\ndividing such Eligible Employee’s Contributions accumulated prior to such Exercise Date and retained in the Eligible Employee’s account as of the Exercise Date by\\nthe applicable Purchase Price; provided that in no event will an Eligible Employee be permitted to purchase during each Purchase Period more than 1,000 (or, in the\\ncase of Offering Periods beginning prior to the First Amendment Effective Date, 750) shares of Common Stock (subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 19) and\\nprovided further that such purchase will be subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(d) and 13. The Eligible Employee may accept the grant of such option (i)\\nwith respect to the first Offering Period by submitting a properly completed subscription agreement in accordance with the requirements of Section 5 on or before the\\nlast day of the Enrollment Window, and (ii) with respect to any subsequent Offering Period under the Plan, by electing to participate in the Plan in accordance with the\\nrequirements of Section 5. The Administrator may, for future Offering Periods, increase or decrease, in its absolute discretion, the maximum number of shares of\\nCommon Stock that an Eligible Employee may purchase during each Purchase Period. Exercise of the option will occur as provided in Section 8, unless the Participant\\nhas withdrawn pursuant to Section 10. The option will expire on the last day of the Offering Period.\\n8.\\nExercise of Option.\\n(a)\\nUnless a Participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10, his or her option for the purchase of shares of Common Stock will\\nbe exercised automatically on each Exercise Date, and the maximum number of full shares subject to the option will be purchased for such Participant at the applicable\\nPurchase Price with the accumulated Contributions from his or her account. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be purchased; any Contributions accumulated\\nin a Participant’s account, which are not sufficient to purchase a full share will be retained in the Participant’s account for the subsequent Purchase Period or Offering\\nPeriod, subject to earlier withdrawal by the Participant as provided in Section 10, or with respect to Offering Periods beginning on or after the Second Amendment\\nEffective Date, will be returned to the Participant shortly after the Exercise Date (unless otherwise determined by the Administrator). Any other funds left over in a\\nParticipant’s account after the Exercise Date will be returned to the Participant. During a Participant’s lifetime, a Participant’s option to purchase shares hereunder is\\nexercisable only by him or her.\\n8\\n(b)\\nIf the Administrator determines that, on a given Exercise Date, the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which options are to\\nbe exercised may exceed (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that were available for sale under the Plan on the Enrollment Date of the applicable Offering\\nPeriod, or (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock available for sale under the Plan on such Exercise Date, the Administrator may in its sole discretion (x) provide\\nthat the Company will make a pro rata allocation of the shares of Common Stock available for purchase on such Enrollment Date or Exercise Date, as applicable, in as\\nuniform a manner as will be practicable and as it will determine in its sole discretion to be equitable among all Participants exercising options to purchase Common\\nStock on such Exercise Date, and continue all Offering Periods then in effect or (y) provide that the Company will make a pro rata allocation of the shares of Common\\nStock available for purchase on such Enrollment Date or Exercise Date, as applicable, in as uniform a manner as will be practicable and as it will determine in its sole\\ndiscretion to be equitable among all participants exercising options to purchase Common Stock on such Exercise Date, and terminate any or all Offering Periods then in\\neffect pursuant to Section 20. The Company may make a pro rata allocation of the shares available on the Enrollment Date of any applicable Offering Period pursuant\\nto the preceding sentence, notwithstanding any authorization of additional shares for issuance under the Plan by the Company’s stockholders subsequent to such\\nEnrollment Date.\\n9.\\nDelivery. As soon as reasonably practicable after each Exercise Date on which a purchase of shares of Common Stock occurs, the Company will\\narrange the delivery to each Participant of the shares purchased upon exercise of his or her option in a form determined by the Administrator (in its sole discretion) and\\npursuant to rules established by the Administrator. The Company may permit or require that shares be deposited directly with a broker designated by the Company or to\\na designated agent of the Company, and the Company may utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer. The Company may require that shares be retained\\nwith such broker or agent for a designated period of time and/or may establish other procedures to permit tracking of disqualifying dispositions of such shares. No\\nParticipant will have any voting, dividend, or other stockholder rights with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to any option granted under the Plan until such\\nshares have been purchased and delivered to the Participant as provided in this Section 9.\\n10.\\nWithdrawal.\\n(a)\\nA Participant may withdraw all but not less than all the Contributions credited to his or her account and not yet used to exercise his or her\\noption under the Plan at any time by (i)\\xa0submitting to the Company’s stock administration office (or its designee) a written notice of withdrawal in the form determined\\nby the Administrator for such purpose (which may be similar to the form attached hereto as Exhibit B), or (ii)\\xa0following an electronic or other withdrawal procedure\\ndetermined by the Administrator. All of the Participant’s Contributions credited to his or her account will be paid to such Participant promptly after receipt of notice of\\nwithdrawal and such Participant’s option for the Offering Period will be automatically terminated, and no further Contributions for the purchase of shares will be made\\nfor such Offering Period. If a Participant withdraws from an Offering Period, Contributions will not resume at the beginning of the succeeding Offering Period, unless\\nthe Participant re-enrolls in the Plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.\\n(b)\\nA Participant’s withdrawal from an Offering Period will not have any effect on his or her eligibility to participate in any similar plan that\\nmay hereafter be adopted by the Company or in succeeding Offering Periods that commence after the termination of the Offering Period from which the Participant\\nwithdraws.\\n11.\\nTermination of Employment. Upon a Participant’s ceasing to be an Eligible Employee, for any reason, he or she will be deemed to have elected to\\nwithdraw from the Plan and the Contributions credited to such Participant’s account during the Offering Period but not yet used to purchase shares of Common Stock\\nunder the Plan will be returned\\n9\\nto such Participant or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 15, and such Participant’s option will be automatically\\nterminated. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, a Participant whose employment transfers between entities through a termination with an immediate rehire\\n(with no break in service) by the Company or a Designated Company will not be treated as terminated under the Plan; however, if a Participant transfers from an\\nOffering under the 423 Component to the Non-423 Component, the exercise of the option will be qualified under the 423 Component only to the extent it complies with\\nSection 423 of the Code, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator.\\n12.\\nInterest. No interest will accrue on the Contributions of a participant in the Plan, except as may be required by Applicable Law, as determined by the\\nCompany, and if so required by the laws of a particular jurisdiction, will apply to all Participants in the relevant Offering under the 423 Component, except to the extent\\notherwise permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section\\xa01.423-2(f).\\n13.\\nStock.\\n(a)\\nSubject to adjustment upon changes in capitalization of the Company as provided in Section 19 hereof, the maximum number of shares of\\nCommon Stock that will be made available for sale under the Plan will be 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock available for\\nissuance under the Plan will be increased on the first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1, 2020 in a number of shares equal to the least of (i)\\xa07,000,000\\nshares of Common Stock (subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 19), (ii) one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of all classes of the Company’s common\\nstock on the last day of the immediately preceding Fiscal Year, or (iii) an amount determined by the Administrator.\\n(b)\\nUntil the shares of Common Stock are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized\\ntransfer agent of the Company), a Participant will have only the rights of an unsecured creditor with respect to such shares, and no right to vote or receive dividends or\\nany other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to such shares.\\n(c)\\nShares of Common Stock to be delivered to a Participant under the Plan will be registered in the name of the Participant or in the name of\\nthe Participant and his or her spouse.\\n14.\\nAdministration. The Plan will be administered by the Board or a Committee appointed by the Board, which Committee will be constituted to comply\\nwith Applicable Laws. The Administrator will have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe, interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to delegate\\nministerial duties to any of the Company’s employees, to designate separate Offerings under the Plan, to designate Subsidiaries and Affiliates of the Company as\\nparticipating in the 423 Component or Non-423 Component, to determine eligibility, to adjudicate all disputed claims filed under the Plan and to establish such\\nprocedures that it deems necessary for the administration of the Plan (including, without limitation, to adopt such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or\\nappropriate to permit the participation in the Plan by employees who are foreign nationals or employed outside the U.S., the terms of which sub-plans may take\\nprecedence over other provisions of this Plan, with the exception of Section\\xa013(a) hereof, but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan, the provisions\\nof this Plan will govern the operation of such sub-plan). Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, the Eligible Employees eligible to participate in each sub-\\nplan will participate in a separate Offering or in the Non-423 Component. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrator is specifically authorized\\nto adopt rules and procedures regarding eligibility to participate, the definition of Compensation, handling of Contributions, making of Contributions to the Plan\\n(including, without limitation, in forms other than payroll deductions), establishment of bank or trust accounts to hold Contributions, payment of interest, conversion of\\nlocal currency, obligations to pay payroll tax, determination of beneficiary designation\\n10\\nrequirements, withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates that vary with applicable local requirements. The Administrator also is authorized to determine\\nthat, to the extent permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section\\xa01.423-2(f), the terms of an option granted under the Plan or an Offering to citizens or residents of a\\nnon-U.S. jurisdiction will be less favorable than the terms of options granted under the Plan or the same Offering to employees resident solely in the U.S. Every finding,\\ndecision, and determination made by the Administrator will, to the full extent permitted by law, be final and binding upon all parties.\\n15.\\nDesignation of Beneficiary.\\n(a)\\nIf permitted by the Administrator, a Participant may file a designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any shares of Common Stock and\\ncash, if any, from the Participant’s account under the Plan in the event of such Participant’s death subsequent to an Exercise Date on which the option is exercised but\\nprior to delivery to such Participant of such shares and cash. In addition, if permitted by the Administrator, a Participant may file a designation of a beneficiary who is\\nto receive any cash from the Participant’s account under the Plan in the event of such Participant’s death prior to exercise of the option. If a Participant is married and\\nthe designated beneficiary is not the spouse, spousal consent will be required for such designation to be effective.\\n(b)\\nSuch designation of beneficiary may be changed by the Participant at any time by notice in a form determined by the Administrator. In the\\nevent of the death of a Participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such Participant’s death, the\\nCompany will deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed\\n(to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of\\nthe Participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.\\n(c)\\nAll beneficiary designations will be in such form and manner as the Administrator may designate from time to time. Notwithstanding\\nSections 15(a) and (b) above, the Company and/or the Administrator may decide not to permit such designations by Participants in non-U.S. jurisdictions to the extent\\npermitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section\\xa01.423-2(f).\\n16.\\nTransferability. Neither Contributions credited to a Participant’s account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive shares of\\nCommon Stock under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as\\nprovided in Section 15 hereof) by the Participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition will be without effect, except that the Company\\nmay treat such act as an election to withdraw funds from an Offering Period in accordance with Section 10 hereof.\\n17.\\nUse of Funds. The Company may use all Contributions received or held by it under the Plan for any corporate purpose, and the Company will not be\\nobligated to segregate such Contributions except under Offerings or for Participants in the Non-423 Component for which Applicable Laws require that Contributions\\nto the Plan by Participants be segregated from the Company’s general corporate funds and/or deposited with an independent third party. Until shares of Common Stock\\nare issued, Participants will have only the rights of an unsecured creditor with respect to such shares.\\n18.\\nReports. Individual accounts will be maintained for each Participant in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to participating Eligible\\nEmployees at least annually, which statements will set forth the amounts\\n11\\nof Contributions, the Purchase Price, the number of shares of Common Stock purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any.\\n19.\\nAdjustments, Dissolution, Liquidation, Merger, or Change in Control.\\n(a)\\nAdjustments. In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, other securities, or other\\nproperty), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Common\\nStock or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Common Stock occurs, the Administrator, in order to\\nprevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, will, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust\\nthe number and class of Common Stock that may be delivered under the Plan, the Purchase Price per share and the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each\\noption under the Plan that has not yet been exercised, and the numerical limits of Sections 7 and 13.\\n(b)\\nDissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any Offering Period then in progress will\\nbe shortened by setting a New Exercise Date, and will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed dissolution or liquidation, unless provided\\notherwise by the Administrator. The New Exercise Date will be before the date of the Company’s proposed dissolution or liquidation. The Administrator will notify\\neach Participant in writing or electronically, prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the Participant’s option has been changed to the New Exercise\\nDate and that the Participant’s option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the\\nOffering Period as provided in Section 10 hereof.\\n(c)\\nMerger or Change in Control. In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding option will be assumed or an equivalent\\noption substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or\\nsubstitute for the option, the Offering Period with respect to which such option relates will be shortened by setting a New Exercise Date on which such Offering Period\\nwill end. The New Exercise Date will occur before the date of the Company’s proposed merger or Change in Control. The Administrator will notify each Participant in\\nwriting or electronically prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the Participant’s option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that the\\nParticipant’s option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period as\\nprovided in Section 10 hereof.\\n20.\\nAmendment or Termination.\\n(a)\\nThe Administrator, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. If\\nthe Plan is terminated, the Administrator, in its discretion, may elect to terminate all outstanding Offering Periods either immediately or upon completion of the\\npurchase of shares of Common Stock on the next Exercise Date (which may be sooner than originally scheduled, if determined by the Administrator in its discretion),\\nor may elect to permit Offering Periods to expire in accordance with their terms (and subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 19). If the Offering Periods are\\nterminated prior to expiration, all amounts then credited to Participants’ accounts that have not been used to purchase shares of Common Stock will be returned to the\\nParticipants (without interest thereon, except as otherwise required under Applicable Laws, as further set forth in Section 12 hereof) as soon as administratively\\npracticable.\\n(b)\\nWithout stockholder consent and without limiting Section 20(a), the Administrator will be entitled to change the Offering Periods or\\nPurchase Periods, designate separate Offerings, limit the frequency and/or\\n12\\nnumber of changes in the amount withheld during an Offering Period, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts withheld in a currency other than U.S. dollars,\\npermit Contributions in excess of the amount designated by a Participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Company’s processing of properly completed\\nContribution elections, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the\\npurchase of Common Stock for each Participant properly correspond with Contribution amounts, and establish such other limitations or procedures as the Administrator\\ndetermines in its sole discretion advisable that are consistent with the Plan.\\n(c)\\nIn the event the Administrator determines that the ongoing operation of the Plan may result in unfavorable financial accounting\\nconsequences, the Administrator may, in its discretion and, to the extent necessary or desirable, modify, amend or terminate the Plan to reduce or eliminate such\\naccounting consequence including, but not limited to:\\n(i)\\namending the Plan to conform with the safe harbor definition under the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting\\nStandards Codification Topic 718 (or any successor thereto), including with respect to an Offering Period underway at the time;\\n(ii) altering the Purchase Price for any Offering Period or Purchase Period including an Offering Period or Purchase Period underway at\\nthe time of the change in Purchase Price;\\n(iii) shortening any Offering Period or Purchase Period by setting a New Exercise Date, including an Offering Period or Purchase Period\\nunderway at the time of the Administrator action;\\n(iv) reducing the maximum percentage of Compensation a Participant may elect to set aside as Contributions; and\\n(v) reducing the maximum number of shares of Common Stock a Participant may purchase during any Offering Period or Purchase\\nPeriod.\\nSuch modifications or amendments will not require stockholder approval or the consent of any Participants.\\n21.\\nNotices. All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan will be deemed to have been duly\\ngiven when received in the form and manner specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.\\n22.\\nConditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares of Common Stock will not be issued with respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the\\nissuance and delivery of such shares pursuant thereto will comply with all applicable provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the U.S.\\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the\\nshares may then be listed, and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.\\nAs a condition to the exercise of an option, the Company may require the person exercising such option to represent and warrant at the time of any\\nsuch exercise that the shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such shares if, in the opinion of counsel for\\nthe Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned applicable provisions of law.\\n13\\n23.\\nCode Section 409A. The 423 Component of the Plan is exempt from the application of Code Section 409A and any ambiguities herein will be\\ninterpreted to so be exempt from Code Section 409A. In furtherance of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, if the Administrator\\ndetermines that an option granted under the Plan may be subject to Code Section 409A or that any provision in the Plan would cause an option under the Plan to be\\nsubject to Code Section 409A, the Administrator may amend the terms of the Plan and/or of an outstanding option granted under the Plan, or take such other action the\\nAdministrator determines is necessary or appropriate, in each case, without the Participant’s consent, to exempt any outstanding option or future option that may be\\ngranted under the Plan from or to allow any such options to comply with Code Section 409A, but only to the extent any such amendments or action by the\\nAdministrator would not violate Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the option\\nto purchase Common Stock under the Plan that is intended to be exempt from or compliant with Code Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant or for any action\\ntaken by the Administrator with respect thereto. The Company makes no representation that the option to purchase Common Stock under the Plan is compliant with\\nCode Section 409A.\\n24.\\nTerm of Plan. The Plan will become effective upon the later to occur of (i)\\xa0its adoption by the Board or (ii)\\xa0the business day immediately prior to the\\nRegistration Date. It will continue in effect for a term of twenty (20) years, unless sooner terminated under Section 20.\\n25.\\nStockholder Approval. The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is\\nadopted by the Board. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.\\n26.\\nGoverning Law. The Plan will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California (except its choice-of-law\\nprovisions).\\n27.\\nNo Right to Employment. Participation in the Plan by a Participant will not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained as an\\nemployee of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company, as applicable. Further, the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company may dismiss a\\nParticipant from employment at any time, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise required pursuant to Applicable Laws.\\n28.\\nSeverability. If any provision of the Plan is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason in any jurisdiction or as to\\nany Participant, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and enforced as to such\\njurisdiction or Participant as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had not been included.\\n29.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Compliance with Applicable Laws. The terms of this Plan are intended to comply with all Applicable Laws and will be construed accordingly.\\n30.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Automatic Transfer to Low Price Offering Period. To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, if the Fair Market Value on any Exercise Date in an\\nOffering Period is lower than the Fair Market Value on the Enrollment Date of such Offering Period, then such Offering Period automatically will be terminated on\\nsuch Exercise Date immediately after the exercise of all options outstanding as of such Exercise Date, and all Participants in such Offering Period automatically will be\\nre-enrolled in the immediately following Offering Period as of the first day thereof.\\n14\\nEXHIBIT A\\nLYFT, Inc.\\n2019 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN\\nSUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT\\nOriginal Application\\nOffering Date:\\nChange in Payroll Deduction Rate\\n1.\\n(\"Employee\") hereby elects to participate in the Lyft, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"Plan\") and subscribes to purchase shares of the\\nCompany\\'s Common Stock in accordance with this Subscription Agreement, including the country specific terms as set forth in the appendix attached hereto, and the\\nPlan. Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the Plan shall have the same defined meanings in this Subscription Agreement.\\n2.\\nEmployee hereby authorizes payroll deductions from each paycheck in the amount of ___% (from 1%) to fifteen percent (15%); a decrease in rate\\nmay be to zero percent (0%)) of his or her Compensation on each payday during the Offering Period in accordance with the Plan. (Please note that no fractional\\npercentages are permitted.)\\n3.\\nEmployee understands said payroll deductions will be accumulated for the purchase of shares of Common Stock at the applicable Purchase Price\\ndetermined in accordance with the Plan. Employee understands that if he or she does not withdraw from an Offering Period, any accumulated payroll deductions will be\\nused to automatically exercise his or her option and purchase Common Stock under the Plan.\\n4.\\nEmployee has received a copy of the complete Plan and its accompanying prospectus. Employee understands that his or her participation in the Plan\\nis in all respects subject to the terms of the Plan.\\n5.\\nShares of Common Stock purchased by Employee under the Plan should be issued in the name of ___________________ Employee (or, if permitted\\nby Applicable Laws and designated by Employee, Employee and Spouse).\\n6.\\nIf an Employee is a U.S. taxpayer, Employee understands that if he or she disposes of any shares that he or she purchased under the Plain within two\\n(2) years after the Enrollment Date (the first day of the Offering Period during which he or she purchased such shares) or (1) year after the applicable Exercise Date, he\\nor she will be treated for federal income tax purposes as having received ordinary income at the time of such disposition in an amount equal to the excess of the fair\\nmarket value of the shares at the time such shares were purchased over the price paid for the shares. If an Employee is a U.S. taxpayer, Employee hereby agrees to\\nnotify the Company in writing within thirty (30) days after the date of any disposition of such shares and to make adequate provision for federal, state or other tax\\nwithholding obligations, if any, that arise upon the disposition of such shares. The Company may, but will not be obligated to, withhold the Employee\\'s compensation\\nthe amount necessary to meet any applicable withholding obligation including any withholding necessary to make available to the Company any tax deductions or\\nbenefits attributable to Employee\\'s sale or disposition of such shares. If an Employee is a U.S. taxpayer, Employee understands that if he or she disposes of such shares\\nat any time after the expiration of the two (2)-year and one (1)-year holding periods, he or she will be treated for federal income tax purposes as having received income\\nonly at the time of such disposition, and that such income will\\n15\\nbe taxed as ordinary income only to the extent of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of such disposition over\\nthe purchase price paid for the shares, or (ii) fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market value of the shares on the first day of the Offering Period. The remainder of the\\ngain, if any, recognized on such disposition will be taxed as capital gain.\\n7.\\nResponsibility for Taxes.\\na.\\nEmployee acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, the Employer, the ultimate liability for all\\nincome tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to Employee\\'s participation in the Plan and legally\\napplicable to Employee (“Tax-Related Items”) is and remains Employee\\'s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company and/or\\nthe Employer. Employee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-\\nRelated Items in connection with any aspect of Employee\\'s participation in the Plan, including the grant or exercise of the option to purchase shares of Common Stock,\\nthe purchase of shares of Common Stock under the Plan, the subsequent sale of such shares acquired under the Plan and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not\\ncommit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the option to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan to reduce or\\neliminate Employee\\'s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Employee is subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one\\njurisdiction, Employee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-\\nRelated Items in more than one jurisdiction.\\nb.\\nPrior to any relevant tax or tax withholding event, as applicable, Employee agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the\\nCompany and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, Employee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy their withholding\\nobligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding from Employee\\'s wages or other cash compensation otherwise payable to Employee by the Company\\nand/or the Employer. If the obligations for Tax-Related Items cannot be satisfied by withholding from Employee\\'s wages or other cash compensation as contemplated\\nherein, then Employee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer or their respective agents to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related\\nItems by withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the option, either through a voluntary sale or through a\\nmandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Employee\\'s behalf pursuant to this authorization, without further consent), or, if such method is problematic under\\napplicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by withholding from the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of\\nthe option to purchase such shares. The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including\\nmaximum applicable rates in Employee\\'s jurisdiction. If Tax-Related Items are withheld in excess of Employee\\'s actual tax liability, any over-withheld amount may be\\nrefunded to Employee in cash (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or, if not refunded, Employee may be entitled to a refund from the local tax, social security\\nor other applicable authorities. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, Employee will be deemed to have been\\nissued the full number of Shares subject to the exercised option, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of\\nsatisfying withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items.\\nc.\\nFinally, Employee agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may\\nbe required to withhold as a result of Employee\\'s participation in the Plan or Employee\\'s purchase of shares of Common Stock that cannot be satisfied by the means\\npreviously described. The\\n16\\nCompany may refuse to purchase shares of Common Stock on Employee\\'s behalf under the Plan and refuse to deliver such shares if Employee fails to comply with\\nEmployee\\'s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section.\\n8.\\nNature of Grant. By enrolling in the Plan and making enrollment elections, Employee acknowledges, understands and agrees that:\\n(a)\\nthe Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the\\nCompany at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;\\n(b)\\nthe grant of the option to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any\\ncontractual or other right to receive future grants of options, or benefits in lieu of options, even if options have been granted in the past;\\n(c)\\nall decisions with respect to future options or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;\\n(d)\\nEmployee\\'s participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment or be interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service\\ncontract with the Company, the Employer, any Subsidiary or Affiliate and shall not interfere with the ability of the Employer to terminate Employee\\'s\\nemployment relationship (if any) at any time;\\n(e)\\nEmployee is voluntarily participating in the Plan;\\n(f)\\nthe option and any shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan, and the income from and value of the same, are not intended to replace any\\npension rights or compensation;\\n(g)\\nthe option and any shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan, and the income from and value of the same, are not part of normal or expected\\ncompensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end-of-service payments, holiday pay, bonuses, long-\\nservice awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar mandatory payments;\\n(h)\\nunless otherwise agreed with the Company, in writing, the option and any shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan, and the income from\\nand value of the same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any service Employee may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or\\nAffiliate;\\n(i)\\nthe future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock purchased or to be purchased under the Plan is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be\\npredicted with certainty;\\n(j)\\nif shares of Common Stock are purchased for Employee at the end of an Offering Period, the value of the shares acquired under the Plan may increase\\nor decrease in value, even below the Purchase Price;\\n(k)\\nno claim or entitlement to compensation shall arise from forfeiture of the option to purchase shares of Common Stock resulting from Employee\\nceasing to provide employment or other services to the\\n17\\nCompany or the Employer (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not the termination is later found to be invalid or in breach of\\nemployment laws in the jurisdiction where Employee is employed or the terms of Employee\\'s employment agreement, if any);\\n(l)\\nin the event of Employee\\'s termination of employment (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not the termination is later found\\nto be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where Employee is employed or the terms of Employee\\'s employment agreement, if\\nany), unless otherwise determined by the Company, Employee\\'s right to participate in and to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan, if any,\\nwill terminate effective as of the date that Employee is no longer actively providing services to the Employer, the Company or one of its Designated\\nCompanies and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., active services would not include any contractual notice period or any period of\\n“garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where Employee is employed or the terms of Employee\\'s\\nemployment agreement, if any); the Board (or the Committee) shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Employee is no longer actively\\nproviding services for purposes of Employee\\'s participation in the Plan (including whether Employee may still be considered to be provided services\\nwhile on a leave of absence); and\\n(m)\\nneither the Company, the Employer nor any other Subsidiary or Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between Employee\\'s\\nlocal currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the option or any amounts due to the Employee pursuant to Employee\\'s\\nparticipation in the Plan or the subsequent sale of any shares of Common Stock acquired at purchase.\\n9.\\nData Privacy. Employee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of\\nEmployee’s personal data as described in this Subscription Agreement and any other offering materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer, or the\\nCompany and any Subsidiary or Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Employee’s participation in the Plan.\\nEmployee understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about Employee, including, but not limited to,\\nEmployee’s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance/security number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title,\\nany shares of Common Stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all options to purchase shares of Common Stock or any other entitlement to shares of\\nCommon Stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Employee’s favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing,\\nadministering and managing the Plan.\\nEmployee understands that Data will be transferred to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (“Schwab”), and any other stock plan service provider as may\\nbe selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration, and management of the Plan. Employee\\nunderstands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country of operation (e.g., the United States)\\nmay have different data privacy laws and protections than Employee’s country. Employee understands that if he or she resides outside the United States, he or she\\nmay request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting his or her local human resources representative. Employee\\nauthorizes the Company, Schwab, any other stock plan service provider selected by the Company (presently or in the future), and any other possible recipients\\nwhich may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the\\nData, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing his or her participation\\n18\\nin the Plan. Employee understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Employee’s participation in the Plan.\\nEmployee understands that where provided by law, he or she may exercise rights related to the Data, including, for example the rights to request to view Data,\\nrequest additional information about the storage and processing of Data, request necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any\\ncase without cost, by contacting in writing his or her local human resources representative. Further, Employee understands that he or she is providing the consents\\nherein on a purely voluntary basis. If Employee does not consent, or if Employee later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her status as an Employee and\\ncareer with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing Employee’s consent is that the Company would not be able to allow\\nEmployee\\'s participation in the Plan or administer or maintain such participation. Therefore, Employee understands that refusing or withdrawing his or her\\nconsent may affect Employee’s ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of Employee’s refusal to consent or withdrawal of\\nconsent, Employee understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representative.\\n10.\\nNo Advice Regarding Participation. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any\\nrecommendations regarding Employee\\'s participation in the Plan, or the purchase of shares of Common Stock or the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired under\\nthe Plan. Employee should consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding his or her participation in the Plan before taking any action\\nrelated to the Plan.\\n11.\\nInsider Trading Restrictions/Market Abuse Laws. Depending on Employee\\'s country, the broker’s country or the country in which the shares of\\nCommon Stock are listed, Employee may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions, including but not limited to the\\nUnited States, Employee\\'s country or the broker or any other stock plan service provider’s country, which may affect Employee\\'s ability to directly or indirectly, for\\nEmployee or a third party, accept, acquire, sell, attempt to sell or otherwise dispose of shares of Common Stock, rights to shares of Common Stock (e.g., options) or\\nrights linked to the value of shares of Common Stock during such times as Employee is considered to have “inside information” (as defined by the laws in the\\napplicable jurisdictions) regarding the Company, Employer, or any Subsidiary or Affiliate. Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or\\namendment of orders Employee placed before Employee possessed inside information. Furthermore, Employee could be prohibited from (i) disclosing the inside\\ninformation to any third party, including fellow employees (other than on a “need to know” basis) and (ii) “tipping” third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or\\nsell securities.

Such laws are often complex and change frequently.\\nAs a result, the Company strongly recommends that Employee not rely on the information in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the\\nconsequences of Employee\\'s participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date by the Purchase Date or when Employee sells shares of Common\\nStock acquired under the Plan.\\nIn addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to Employee\\'s particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure\\nEmployee of a particular result. Accordingly, Employee should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in Employee\\'s country may apply to his\\nor her situation.\\nFinally, if Employee is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which Employee is currently residing and/or working, transfers employment and/or\\nresidency after the Offering Date, or is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein may not be applicable to\\nEmployee in the same manner.\\n22\\nData Privacy Notice for Employees Inside the European Union and European Economic Area\\nPurposes and Legal Bases of Processing. The Company processes Data (as defined below) for the purpose of administering and managing Employee\\'s\\nparticipation in the Plan and facilitating compliance with applicable tax, exchange control, securities and labor law. The legal basis for the processing of Data by\\nthe Company and the third-party service providers described below is the necessity of the data processing for the Company to perform its contractual obligations in\\nconnection with the option to purchase shares of Common Stock and for the Company’s legitimate business interests of managing the Plan and generally\\nadministering employee equity awards.\\nData Collection and Processing. The Company collects, processes and uses the following types of personal information about Employee: Employee\\'s name,\\naddress, telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number, passport or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares\\nor directorships held in the Company details of all shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan or any other entitlement to shares awarded, canceled,\\nexercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Employee\\'s favor (“Data”), for the legitimate purpose of managing Employee\\'s participation in the Plan.\\nStock Plan Administration Service Providers. The Company transfers Data to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (“Schwab”), an independent service provider based in\\nthe U.S. which assists the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. In the future, the Company may select a different\\nservice provider and share Data with such different service provider that serves the Company in a similar manner. Employee may be asked to agree on separate\\nterms and data processing practices with Schwab, with such agreement being a condition for Employee to participate in the Plan. The Company may further\\ntransfer Data to other third party service providers, if necessary to ensure compliance with applicable tax, exchange control, securities and labor law. Such third\\nparty service providers may include the Company’s outside legal counsel and auditor.\\nInternational Data Transfers. The Company and Schwab operate, relevant to the Company, in the U.S., which means that it will be necessary for Data to be\\ntransferred to, and processed in, the U.S. Employee understands and acknowledges that the U.S. is not subject to an unlimited adequacy finding by the European\\nCommission and that Employee\\'s Data may not have an equivalent level of protection as compared to Employee\\'s country of residence. The Company complies\\nwith applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for these transfers of Data. Data that the Company collects from Employee will be transferred to,\\nand stored at/processed in the United States, under the European Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e., the\\nstandard contractual clauses), pursuant to Decision 2004/915/EC. Employee should contact [***] should he or she wish to examine the intra-group standard data\\nprotection clauses entered into by the Company Group.\\nData Retention. The Company will hold and use Data only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Employee\\'s participation in the Plan, or\\nas required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including under tax, exchange control, labor and securities laws, which may extend beyond Employee\\'s\\nemployment. Once the required retention period has elapsed for any of the above purposes, the Company will cease processing of Data to the fullest extent\\npracticable.\\nData Subject Rights. Employee may have a number of rights under applicable data privacy laws. Depending on where Employee is based, such rights may include\\nthe right to (i) request access to or copies of Data the Company processes, (ii) rectify incorrect Data, (iii) delete Data, (iv) restrict the processing of Data, (v) restrict\\nthe portability of Data, (vi) lodge complaints with competent authorities in Employee\\'s jurisdiction, and/or (vii) receive a list with the names and addresses of any\\npotential recipients of Data. To receive clarification regarding these rights or to exercise these rights, Employee can contact [***].\\nContractual Requirement. Employee\\'s provision of Data and its processing as described above is a contractual requirement and a condition to Employee\\'s ability\\nto participate in the Plan. Employee understands that, as a\\n23\\nconsequence of Employee refusing to provide Data, the Company may not be able to allow Employee to participate in the Plan, allow Employee to purchase of any\\nshares of Common Stock or grant other equity awards to Employee or administer or maintain such awards. However, Employee\\'s participation in the Plan is purely\\nvoluntary. While Employee will not receive the option to purchase shares of Common Stock or any other equity awards if Employee decides against providing Data\\nas described above, Employee\\'s career and salary will not be affected in any way.\\n24\\nCANADA\\nTerms and Conditions\\nTermination of Employment. The following provision replaces Section 8(l) of the Subscription Agreement:\\nIn the event of Employee\\'s termination of employment or other services to the Company, the Employer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate (regardless of the reason for such\\ntermination and whether or not the termination is later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where Employee is employed or under\\nthe terms of Employee\\'s employment agreement, if any), Employee understands that he or she shall cease to have any right or entitlement to participate in the Plan and\\npurchase any shares of Common Stock under the Plan. For purposes of the preceding sentence, and unless otherwise required by Applicable Laws, Employee\\nunderstands that his or her right to participate in the Plan will terminate effective as of the earliest of (i) the date Employee\\'s employment is terminated, (ii) the date\\nEmployee receives written notice of termination of employment from the Employer and (iii) the date on which Employee is no longer actively employed, regardless of\\nany notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice required under local law (including, but not limited to statutory law, regulatory law and/or common law). In the\\nevent the date of Employee\\'s termination cannot be reasonably determined under the terms of the Subscription Agreement and the Plan, the Board (or the Committee)\\nshall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Employee is no longer actively providing service for purposes of Employee\\'s participation in the Plan (including\\nwhether Employee may still be considered to be provided services while on a leave of absence).\\nThe following provisions apply to Employees in Quebec:\\nData Privacy. The following provision supplements the “Data Privacy” provision of the Subscription Agreement:\\nEmployee hereby authorizes the Company and the Company’s representative to discuss with and obtain all relevant information from all personnel (professional or\\nnon-professional) involved with the administration of the Plan. Employees further authorizes the Company, the Employer, and any other stock plan service provider as\\nmay be selected by the Company or the Employer in the future to assist with the Plan to disclose and discuss Employee\\'s participation in the Plan with their advisors.\\nEmployee also authorizes the Company and the Employer to record such information and keep it in Employee\\'s employee file.\\nConsent to Receive Information in English. The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that the option grant, as well as all documents, notices and legal\\nproceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English.\\nLes parties reconnaissent avoir exigé la rédaction en anglais de cette Convention, ainsi que de tous documents exécutés, avis donnés et procédures judiciaries\\nintentées, directement ou indirectement, relativement à ou suite à la présente Convention.\\nNotifications\\nSecurities Law Acknowledgment. Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee will sell shares of Common Stock acquired through participation in the Plan only\\noutside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed. Currently, the shares of Common Stock are listed on\\nNasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “LYFT”.\\nForeign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Employee is required to report any foreign specified property (including Common Stock acquired under the Plan) with a\\nvalue exceeding C$100,000 on Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement) on an annual basis. The statement is due at the same time as Employee’s annual\\ntax return. The shares of Common Stock must be reported (generally, at nil cost) on Form 1135 if the C$100,000 value threshold is\\n25\\nexceeded due to other foreign specified property Employee holds. When shares of Common Stock are acquired, their value generally is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”)\\nof such shares. The ACB would ordinarily equal the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if Employee owns other Shares, this ACB may have\\nto be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares.\\nGERMANY\\nNotifications\\nExchange Control Information. Cross-border payments in excess of €12,500 in connection with the sale of securities (e.g., shares of Common Stock) and/or dividends\\nreceived in relation to shares must be reported monthly to the German Federal Bank. Employee is responsible for satisfying the reporting obligation and must file the\\nreport electronically by the fifth day of the month following the month in which the payment is received. A copy of the form can accessed via the German Federal\\nBank\\'s website at www.budesbank.de and is available in both German and English. No report is required for payments less than €12,500.\\nMEXICO\\nTerms and Conditions\\nAuthorization for Plan Participation. The following provision supplements Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Subscription Agreement:\\nEmployee hereby authorizes Lyft Platform Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (\"Lyft Mexico\" and/or \"the Employer\"), to take Contributions in the form of payroll deductions\\nfrom Employee\\'s Compensation for each pay period in the U.S. dollar amount of Employee\\'s Compensation that Employee has specified during enrollment. This\\nwithholding will continue until Employee informs the Employer in writing to stop such payroll deductions.\\nEmployee hereby further requests that the accumulated Contributions to which the preceding paragraph refers shall be delivered by the Employer to the Company and\\nshall be used by the Company or its designated broker to purchase shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and the\\nSubscription Agreement.\\nEmployee acknowledges and agrees that the participation of the Employer in the Plan is limited to acting as an intermediary in delivering to the Company the amounts\\nwithheld from Employee\\'s Compensation each pay period and that the benefits under the Plan are not fringe benefits provided by the Employer. The Employer will\\nmake no additional salary payment or other compensation to Employee as a result of the Plan. Employee further acknowledges that the deductions Employee has\\nauthorized are not a loss of salary and that Employee have received in full his or her entire salary for each pay period during Employee\\'s participation in the Plan.\\nAcknowledgement of the Subscription Agreement. By accepting the Subscription Agreement, Employee acknowledges that Employee has received a copy of the Plan\\nand the Subscription Agreement, including this Appendix, which Employee has reviewed. Employee further acknowledges that Employee accepts all the provisions of\\nthe Plan and the Subscription Agreement, including this Appendix. Employee also acknowledges that Employee has read and specifically and expressly approves the\\nterms and conditions set forth in Section 8 of the Subscription Agreement, which clearly provide as follows:\\n(1)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Employee\\'s participation in the Plan does not constitute an acquired right;\\n(2)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Plan and Employee\\'s participation in it are offered by the Company on a wholly discretionary basis;\\n(3)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Employee\\'s participation in the Plan is voluntary; and\\n26\\n(4)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates are not responsible for any decrease in the value of any shares of Common Stock acquired at\\npurchase.\\nLabor Law Acknowledgement and Policy Statement. By accepting the Subscription Agreement, Employee acknowledges that the Company with registered offices at\\n185 Berry Street, 5000, San Francisco, CA 94107, United States of America, is solely responsible for the administration of the Plan. Employee further acknowledges\\nthat Employee\\'s participation in the Plan, the offer of participation, the grant of the option and any acquisition of shares of Common Stock under the Plan do not\\nconstitute an employment relationship between Employee and the Company because Employee is participating in the Plan on a wholly commercial basis and\\nEmployee\\'s sole employer is a Mexican legal entity, Lyft Platform Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Lyft Mexico”). Based on the foregoing, Employee expressly\\nacknowledges that the Plan and the benefits that Employee may derive from participation in the Plan do not establish any rights between Employee and the Employer,\\nLyft Mexico, and do not form part of the employment conditions and/or benefits provided by Lyft Mexico, and any modification of the Plan or its termination shall not\\nconstitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of Employee\\'s employment.\\nEmployee further understands that Employee\\'s participation in the Plan is the result of a unilateral and discretionary decision of the Company, therefore, the Company\\nreserves the absolute right to amend and/or discontinue Employee\\'s participation in the Plan at any time, without any liability to Employee.\\nFinally, Employee hereby declares that Employee does not reserve any action or right to bring any claim against the Company and/or Lyft Mexico for any\\ncompensation regarding any provision of the Plan or the benefits derived under the Plan, and that Employee therefore grants a full and broad release to Lyft Mexico, the\\nCompany, its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, with respect to any claim that may arise.\\nMÉXICO\\nTérminos y Condiciones\\nAutorización para Participación en el Plan.

El Empleado asimismo reconoce\\nque su participación en el Plan, la oferta de participación, el otorgamiento de la opción y cualquier adquisición de Acciones Ordinarias conforme al Plan, no constituye\\nuna relación laboral entre el Empleado y la Sociedad, debido a que el Empleado participa en el Plan sobre una base exclusivamente comercial, y que el único patrón del\\nEmpleado es la persona moral mexicana Lyft Platform México, S. de R.L. de C.V.

It recognizes \\nwhen a workflow is complete and can proactively correct its actions if needed. In case \\u2028\\nof failure, it can halt execution and transfer control back to the user.\\n02\"),\n",

A traditional rules engine works like a checklist, \\nflagging transactions based on preset criteria. In contrast, an LLM agent functions more like a \\nseasoned investigator, evaluating context, considering subtle patterns, and identifying suspicious \\nactivity even when clear-cut rules aren’t violated. This nuanced reasoning capability is exactly what \\nenables agents to manage complex, ambiguous situations effectively.\\nAs you evaluate where agents can add value, prioritize workflows that have previously resisted \\nautomation, especially where traditional methods encounter friction:\\n01\\nComplex \\u2028\\ndecision-making:\\xa0\\nWorkflows involving nuanced judgment, exceptions, or \\u2028\\ncontext-sensitive decisions, for example refund approval \\u2028\\nin customer service workflows.\\n02\\nDifficult-to-maintain \\nrules:\\nSystems that have become unwieldy due to extensive and \\nintricate rulesets, making updates costly or error-prone, \\u2028\\nfor example performing vendor security reviews.\\xa0\\n03\\nHeavy reliance on \\nunstructured data:\\nScenarios that involve interpreting natural language, \\u2028\\nextracting meaning from documents, or interacting with \\u2028\\nusers conversationally, for example processing a home \\ninsurance claim.\\xa0\\nBefore committing to building an agent, validate that your use case can meet these criteria clearly. \\nOtherwise, a deterministic solution may suffice.\\n6\\nA practical guide to building agents\\nAgent design \\nfoundations'),\n",

As we’ll see in the next section on Orchestration, you might want to consider using a variety \\u2028\\nof models for different tasks in the workflow.\\nNot every task requires the smartest model—a simple retrieval or intent classification task may be \\nhandled by a smaller, faster model, while harder tasks like deciding whether to approve a refund \\nmay benefit from a more capable model.\\nAn approach that works well is to build your agent prototype with the most capable model for \\nevery task to establish a performance baseline. From there, try swapping in smaller models to see \\u2028\\nif they still achieve acceptable results. This way, you don’t prematurely limit the agent’s abilities, \\nand you can diagnose where smaller models succeed or fail.\\nIn summary, the principles for choosing a model are simple:\\xa0\\n01\\nSet up evals to establish a performance baseline\\n02\\nFocus on meeting your accuracy target with the best models available\\n03\\nOptimize for cost and latency by replacing larger models with smaller ones \\u2028\\nwhere possible\\nYou can find a comprehensive guide to selecting OpenAI models here.\\n8\\nA practical guide to building agents\\nDefining tools'),\n",

In customer service for example, routines can roughly \\nmap to individual articles in your knowledge base.\\xa0\\nPrompt agents to break \\u2028\\ndown tasks\\nProviding smaller, clearer steps from dense resources \\u2028\\nhelps minimize ambiguity and helps the model better \\u2028\\nfollow instructions.\\nDefine clear actions\\nMake sure every step in your routine corresponds to a specific \\naction or output. For example, a step might instruct the agent \\nto ask the user for their order number or to call an API to \\nretrieve account details. Being explicit about the action (and \\neven the wording of a user-facing message) leaves less room \\u2028\\nfor errors in interpretation.\\xa0\\nCapture edge cases\\nReal-world interactions often create decision points such as \\nhow to proceed when a user provides incomplete information \\u2028\\nor asks an unexpected question.

It includes frameworks for identifying promising use cases, clear patterns for designing \\nagent logic and orchestration, and best practices to ensure your agents run safely, predictably, \\u2028\\nand effectively.\\xa0\\nAfter reading this guide, you’ll have the foundational knowledge you need to confidently start \\nbuilding your first agent.\\n3\\nA practical guide to building agents\\nWhat is an \\nagent?\\nWhile conventional software enables users to streamline and automate workflows, agents are able \\nto perform the same workflows on the users’ behalf with a high degree of independence.\\nAgents are systems that independently accomplish tasks on your behalf.\\nA workflow is a sequence of steps that must be executed to meet the user’s goal, whether that's \\nresolving a customer service issue, booking a restaurant reservation, committing a code change, \\u2028\\nor generating a report.\\nApplications that integrate LLMs but don’t use them to control workflow execution—think simple \\nchatbots, single-turn LLMs, or sentiment classifiers—are not agents.\\nMore concretely, an agent possesses core characteristics that allow it to act reliably and \\nconsistently on behalf of a user:\\n01\\nIt leverages an LLM to manage workflow execution and make decisions. It recognizes \\nwhen a workflow is complete and can proactively correct its actions if needed. In case \\u2028\\nof failure, it can halt execution and transfer control back to the user.\\n02\"),\n",

A traditional rules engine works like a checklist, \\nflagging transactions based on preset criteria. In contrast, an LLM agent functions more like a \\nseasoned investigator, evaluating context, considering subtle patterns, and identifying suspicious \\nactivity even when clear-cut rules aren’t violated. This nuanced reasoning capability is exactly what \\nenables agents to manage complex, ambiguous situations effectively.\\nAs you evaluate where agents can add value, prioritize workflows that have previously resisted \\nautomation, especially where traditional methods encounter friction:\\n01\\nComplex \\u2028\\ndecision-making:\\xa0\\nWorkflows involving nuanced judgment, exceptions, or \\u2028\\ncontext-sensitive decisions, for example refund approval \\u2028\\nin customer service workflows.\\n02\\nDifficult-to-maintain \\nrules:\\nSystems that have become unwieldy due to extensive and \\nintricate rulesets, making updates costly or error-prone, \\u2028\\nfor example performing vendor security reviews.\\xa0\\n03\\nHeavy reliance on \\nunstructured data:\\nScenarios that involve interpreting natural language, \\u2028\\nextracting meaning from documents, or interacting with \\u2028\\nusers conversationally, for example processing a home \\ninsurance claim.\\xa0\\nBefore committing to building an agent, validate that your use case can meet these criteria clearly. \\nOtherwise, a deterministic solution may suffice.\\n6\\nA practical guide to building agents\\nAgent design \\nfoundations'),\n",

        "\n",
        "Embedding the chunks of text is a crucial step in preparing the data for storage in a **vector database** like Qdrant. In this step, we convert each text chunk into a **numerical representation** (vector) that captures its semantic meaning. This allows us to perform advanced operations like **semantic search**, **similarity comparison**, and **retrieval** based on meaning, rather than just keyword matching.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why we Embed?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Vector Representation**: Embedding transforms text into vectors (lists of numbers) that machine learning models can understand. These vectors represent the **semantic meaning** of the text, allowing similar texts to be grouped together, even if they don’t share exact words.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Efficient Search**: Storing these vectors in a vector database enables **fast similarity searches**. For example, if you ask a question or search for a document, the vector database can quickly find and return the most relevant results based on the meaning of the text, not just exact matches.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Contextual Understanding**: The embedding process allows the system to \"understand\" the context of words, which improves the relevance and accuracy of search results. For example, it helps understand that \"machine learning\" and \"artificial intelligence\" are related concepts, even if they don't appear together in the same document.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Transforms text** into dense vectors, capturing the **semantic essence** of the content.\n",
