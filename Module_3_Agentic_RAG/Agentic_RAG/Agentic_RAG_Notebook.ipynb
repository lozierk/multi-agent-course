    "# Deep Dive Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "An Agentic RAG is required when we use reasoning to determine which action(s) to take and in which order to take them. Essentially we use agents instead of a LLM directly to accomplish a set of tasks which requires planning, multi step reasoning, tool use and/or learning over time. Agents give us agency!\n",
    "\n",
    "Agency : The ability to take action or to choose what action to take\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of RAG, we can plug in agents to enhance the reasoning prior to selection of RAG pipelines, within a RAG pipeline for retrieval or reranking and finally for synthesising before we send out the response. This improves RAG to a large extent by automating complex workflows and decisions that are required for a non trivial RAG use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of this Agentic RAG\n",
    "This notebook presents a practical implementation of Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—a system where decision-making and tool selection are delegated to an intelligent agent before executing a response. Rather than passing every query through a static RAG pipeline, this system introduces agency—the ability to choose the best course of action depending on the nature of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of this implementation is a router prompt, which classifies user queries into one of three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OpenAI documentation: Queries related to tools, APIs, or usage guidelines for OpenAI models\n",
    "- 10-K financial reports: Questions requiring retrieval from company filings or financial datasets\n",
    "- Live Internet search: Broader, current, or comparative queries that need web access\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the query is classified, the system invokes a corresponding route handler:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For OpenAI and 10-K queries, it retrieves relevant context from a vector database (Qdrant) using text embeddings, then applies a RAG-based response generator.\n",
    "- For Internet queries, it fetches real-time information using a web-access API (ARES).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is an example of Agentic RAG, where reasoning precedes retrieval and generation. By plugging in agents before and within the RAG pipeline, we make the system smarter and more adaptive. This allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically choose the right retrieval method based on context\n",
    "- Combine structured knowledge with real-time search\n",
    "- Scale RAG beyond trivial use cases by integrating multi-step decision logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, no external agentic frameworks are used—this is a ground-up implementation that demonstrates how to build a lightweight but intelligent agentic system using only a language model, prompt engineering, and retrieval tools."

    "## 2. Router Query Function — Giving the Agent Its Brain\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will define the router function, which plays a critical role in our Agentic RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Router?\n",
    "\n",
    "A router is like the decision-making brain of our assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before trying to answer a user's question, the system first needs to figure out:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Where should I go to find the right answer?”\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this decision, we use the OpenAI GPT model. We provide it with a detailed system prompt that explains how to classify the user's question into one of these categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OPENAI_QUERY** → Questions about OpenAI tools, APIs, models, or documentation.\n",
    "- **10K_DOCUMENT_QUERY** → Questions about companies, financial filings, or analysis based on 10-K reports.\n",
    "- **INTERNET_QUERY** → Anything else that likely requires real-time or general web information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does the function do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sends the user's question to the OpenAI API.\n",
    "- Receives a JSON response containing:\n",
    "  - `action`: The category the query belongs to.\n",
    "  - `reason`: A short explanation for the decision.\n",
    "  - `answer`: (Optional) A quick response if it’s simple enough (left blank for internet queries).\n",
    "- Parses the response and returns it as a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "This router gives the system agency—the ability to decide which knowledge source to use. It’s what makes this pipeline agentic, not just static.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the router, every query would follow the same path. With it, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamically switch between tools and data sources.\n",
    "- Handle different types of user questions intelligently.\n",
    "- Avoid wasting resources on unnecessary steps.\n"

      "To work with chat completions, you start by initializing your agent with a set of instructions and tools it needs to perform its tasks. For example, if the agent is made for web searching and saving results, you initialize it with a name, instructions, and provide the WebSearchTool and save_results in the list of tools.\n",

      "You write high-quality instructions for the agents. Clear instructions are important to reduce ambiguity and improve decision-making, leading to smoother workflow execution and fewer errors. \n",

      "To configure these instructions, you can use existing documents such as operating procedures, support scripts, or policy documents to create LLM-friendly routines. \n",

      "The best ways to build an agent include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Design Foundations: Ensure that your agent consists of three core components: a Model (for reasoning and decision making), Tools (functions or APIs for action), and Instructions (guidelines and guardrails for behavior).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Model Selection: Choose your model with care, considering task complexity, latency, and cost. Smaller models may handle simple tasks but complex tasks may need a more capable model. Initial prototypes should use the most capable model for a performance baseline. Afterward, smaller models can be tested for effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Tools: Ensure your agent has all the necessary tools it would need to perform actions. If the number of required tools increases considerably, consider splitting tasks across multiple agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Instructions: Clear instructions are essential to guide the agent's operations. They should be unambiguous and specific. This is vital for agent decision-making and smoother workflow execution. Using existing operational procedures or protocols can help in formulating effective instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Consider edge cases: Real-world interactions can present unexpected challenges or anomalies. A robust routine anticipates these and includes instructions on how to handle them. \n",
      "\n",
      "6. Test and Evaluate: Testing the agent's performance and evaluating its effectiveness are crucial steps in building a well-functioning agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Continuously Monitor and Improve: After implementation, continue to monitor the agent's performance to identify areas of improvement, and make necessary updates and refinements.\n",

    "In our current agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setup, there's a key limitation: when a user submits a query that contains multiple distinct questions phrased as a single input, the system treats it as a single unified search. As a result, the retrieval engine performs only one operation on the vector databases or external tools, which often leads to incomplete or less relevant results.\n",

Each subquery is processed independently, allowing the system to retrieve more accurate and context-specific information. By handling these subqueries separately, the agent can generate more complete and relevant responses."
