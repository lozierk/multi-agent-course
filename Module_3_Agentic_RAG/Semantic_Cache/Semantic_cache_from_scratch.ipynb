        "- **Nomic text embeddings** (`nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5`) to convert documents and queries into dense vectors  \n",

        "- **Traversaal Pro API** to perform RAG over the AWS documentation corpus when a cache miss occurs  \n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than re-computing embeddings and retrieval for every query, our cache lets us:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Embed** each new query and check if it's already \"covered\" by a cached result  \n",
        "2. **Fall back** to a full RAG retrieval (and store the new result) only when necessary  \n",
        "3. **Skip the cache entirely** for time-sensitive questions that need a fresh answer  \n",
        "4. **Invoke** the Traversaal Pro API for document-grounded answers on cache misses  \n",
        "\n",
        "This approach reduces redundant compute, lowers end-to-end latency, and makes RAG pipelines more efficient—especially when query patterns exhibit repetition or high similarity. We'll walk through:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Loading the Nomic embed model with `trust_remote_code=True`  \n",
        "2. Building a FAISS index for fast L2 nearest-neighbor lookup  \n",
        "3. Implementing the core cache hit/miss logic with a time-sensitivity filter  \n",
        "4. Falling back to Traversaal Pro RAG API for live document retrieval on cache misses  \n",
        "5. Measuring performance gains against a \"no-cache\" baseline  \n",
        "\n",
        "By the end, you'll have a reusable semantic cache scaffold that you can plug into any RAG or search-over-embeddings pipeline. Let's get started!"

It is conceptually similar to a folder in a traditional file-storage system. Before you can store data in S3, you need to create a bucket. Each bucket has a globally unique name across all AWS accounts, and objects are stored within these buckets using unique keys to identify them. Access control and billing are also managed at the bucket level [1].\",\"references\":[{\"score\":0.80882984,\"file_id\":\"file_94bf098ddc80e7ca\",\"chunk_index\":1,\"chunk_text\":\"Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)\\nWhat is it?\\nAmazon Simple Storage Service, commonly known as S3, is a fast, scalable, and durable\\nobject-storage service. S3 can be used to store and retrieve any type and any amount of data.\\nHow does it work?\\nAt its core, S3 is an object-storage service. which is diﬀerent from the traditional ﬁle-storage\\nservice. Data in S3 is stored as objects. Each object contains a unique identiﬁer, some\\nmetadata about the object and the data itself.\\nKey Concepts\\nBuckets\\nAn S3 bucket is conceptually similar to a folder in a ﬁle-storage system. Objects in S3 are\\nstored within a bucket. An S3 bucket needs to be created before data can be stored in S3.\\nFor e.g. if there is an object with the key omgcat.png in the S3 bucket adorable-cat-\\nphotos, \\nthen \\nthe \\naddressable \\npath \\nof \\nthe \\nobject \\nis \\ns3://adorable-cat-\\nphotos/omgcat.png.\\nBuckets are important to understand for some of the following reasons:\\nS3 bucket names are globally unique across all AWS accounts. For e.g. if a bucket with the\\nname adorable-cat-photos already exists, nobody else will be able to create a bucket\\nwith this name.\\nAccess Control can be implemented at bucket level\\nAWS billing is based on aggregate bucket sizes\\nObject keys\\nTo create an object in S3, a key must be speciﬁed. This key uniquely identiﬁes an object\\nwithin a bucket. Since S3 is an object-storage service with a ﬂat namespace (no hierarchy), it\\nhas no concept of folders.\\nThe following are all valid keys for an object:\\nomgcatphoto.png \\ncatvideos/omgwhatacat.mp4 \\nphotos/2020/11/11/photo-of-the-day.png \\nObject Metadata\\nThere are two kinds of metadata associated with an object: system metadata and user-\\ndeﬁned metadata. User-deﬁned metadata can be added when an object is created or\\nupdated.\\nSome examples of system metadata are:\\nObject creation date\",\"original_file_name\":\"aws-guide (1).pdf\"},{\"score\":0.68136007,\"file_id\":\"file_94bf098ddc80e7ca\",\"chunk_index\":3,\"chunk_text\":\"Creating a bucket\\nCLI\\naws s3 mb s3://bucket-name\\nPython (boto3)\\ns3_client = boto3.client('s3') \\ns3_client.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name) \\nList buckets and objects\\nCLI\\n# List all buckets \\naws s3 ls \\n \\n# List objects within bucket \\naws s3 ls s3://bucket-name\\nPython (boto3)\\ns3_client = boto3.client('s3') \\n \\n# List all buckets \\ns3_client.list_buckets() \\n \\n# List objects within bucket \\ns3_client.list_objects(Bucket=bucket_name) \\nDelete buckets\\nCLI\\naws s3 rb s3://bucket-name\\nPython (boto3)\\ns3_client = boto3.client('s3') \\ns3_client.delete_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name) \\n\\n\\nDelete objects\\nCLI\\naws s3 rm s3://bucket-name/object-key\\nPython (boto3)\\ns3_client = boto3.client('s3') \\ns3_client.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object_key) \\nCopy objects\\nThe following command can be used to move objects from a bucket or a local directory\\n# Copy from one bucket to another \\naws s3 cp s3://old-bucket/example s3://new-bucket/ \\n \\n# Copy from local directory to bucket \\naws s3 cp /tmp/filename.txt s3://bucket-name\\nPython (boto3)\\ns3_client = boto3.client('s3') \\n \\n# Copy object from one bucket to another \\ns3_client.copy_object( \\n  Bucket=destination_bucket, \\n  CopySource={\\\"Bucket\\\": original_bucket, \\\"Key\\\": object_key\\\"} \\n) \\n \\n# Copy object from local directory to S3 \\ns3_client.upload_file( \\n  Filename=local_file_path,  # /tmp/filename.txt \\n  Bucket=bucket,  # bucket-name \\n  Key=file_key,  # filename.txt \\n)\",\"original_file_name\":\"aws-guide (1).pdf\"},{\"score\":0.6708532,\"file_id\":\"file_94bf098ddc80e7ca\",\"chunk_index\":2,\"chunk_text\":\"Storage class for the object\\nObject size in bytes\\nStorage classes\\nS3 provides multiple storage classes which are designed for diﬀerent use-cases.\\nStandard\\nIdeal for frequently accessed or performance-critical data\\nMost expensive storage class\\nIntelligent-Tiering\\nAutomatically moves objects between access tiers based on access patterns\\nGood for use-cases when access patterns are ambiguous\\nStandard Infrequent-access\\nIdeal for long-lived and less frequently access data\\nStorage is cheaper than the Standard class but there is a retrieval fee for data access\\nGlacier\\nIdeal for long-term archiving.\\nConﬁgurable retrieval times (minutes to hours).\\nMore information about Storage classes can be found here.\\nWhen to use it?\\nS3 is a ﬂexible storage service and thus can be used for a variety of use-cases.

S3\\ncan also be conﬁgured with CloudFront (Amazon's CDN) to improve delivery performance\\nfor such content.\\nData Lake: S3 is ideal for storing raw, unstructured data in any format and thus can be\\nused as the storage layer for building a Data Lake\\nLogs, Backups, and snapshots: S3's infrequent access tier makes storing logs, backups,\\nand snapshots a good-ﬁt. Some of the services which integrate with S3 are RDS, EBS, and\\nCloudTrail.\\nExamples\\nSome examples of how to use S3 for various use-cases:\\nHow to create a blog on AWS using S3 in 3 easy steps\\nBuild Your Data Lake on Amazon S3\\nAmazon RDS Snapshot Export to S3\\nGetting Started\\nThe following examples will take us through some of the more common operations for S3.\",\"original_file_name\":\"aws-guide (1).pdf\"}]}"

Each S3 bucket is globally unique across all AWS accounts, meaning that no two buckets can have the same name. Objects are stored within these buckets, and you must create a bucket before you can store any data in S3. For example, if you have an object named \"omgcat.png\" in a bucket called \"adorable-cat-photos,\" the addressable path for that object would be \"s3://adorable-cat-photos/omgcat.png\" [1].\n",

            "4. **Triggers**: Functions are triggered by specific events, which can originate from other AWS services or custom applications. For example, a function can be triggered when a new object is uploaded to Amazon S3.\n",
