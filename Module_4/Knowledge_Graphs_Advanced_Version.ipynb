        "In the [basic notebook for Module 4](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hamzafarooq/multi-agent-course/blob/main/Module_4/Knowledge_Graphs_Basic_Version.ipynb) of [Enterprise RAG and Multi-Agent Applications](https://maven.com/boring-bot/advanced-llm), we explored the fundamentals of knowledge graph construction and Graph RAG. We built a hotel reviews knowledge graph, migrated it to Neo4j, and implemented a template-based retriever for answering natural language queries about our graph data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This advanced notebook builds on those foundations to explore more sophisticated Graph RAG techniques and hybrid approaches. While our basic notebook focused on core concepts and implementation, this notebook delves into methods that significantly enhance both the graph itself and our retrieval capabilities - including the pattern most frequently discussed in modern Graph RAG demonstrations, the LLM-driven extraction of structured triplets from unstructured text.\n",
