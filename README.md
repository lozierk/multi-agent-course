## How to Use This Repo

- This repo contains supplemental content for the course. Content is organized **week by week**, aligned with live sessions and project milestones.
- **Google Colab Pro** is the preferred environment for running notebooks.
- You may also **clone the repo locally** and run notebooks using Jupyter or your IDE.
- Each notebook includes its own dependencies via `!pip install` — there is **no global `requirements.txt`**.
